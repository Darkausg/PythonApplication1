@@1514 Albert of Prussia ( 17 May 1490 20 March 1568 ) was the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights , who after converting to Lutheranism , became the first monarch of the Duchy of Prussia , the secularized state that emerged from the former Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights . Albert was the first European ruler to establish Protestantism as the official state religion of his lands . He proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage , ruling the Prussian lands for nearly six decades ( 15101568 ) . A member of the Brandenburg-Ansbach branch of the House of Hohenzollern , Albert 's election as Grand Master had brought about hopes of a reversal of the declining fortune of the Teutonic Knights . He was a skilled political administrator and leader , and did indeed reverse the decline of the Teutonic Order .

He was active in imperial politics , joining the League of Torgau in 1526 , and acted in unison with the Protestants in plotting to overthrow Emperor Charles V after the issue of the Augsburg Interim in May 1548 . Albert established schools in every town and founded Knigsberg University in 1544 . He promoted culture and arts , patronising the works of Erasmus Reinhold and Caspar Hennenberger .

Albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power , and died at Tapiau on 20 March 1568 . His son Albert Frederick succeeded him as Duke of Prussia . Albert 's dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia , paving the way for the rise of the House of Hohenzollern . He is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of Germany . # Early life # Albert was born in Ansbach in Franconia as the third son of Frederick I , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . His mother was Sophia , daughter of Casimir IV Jagiellon , Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland , and his wife Elisabeth of Austria . He was raised for a career in the Church and spent some time at the court of Hermann IV of Hesse , Elector of Cologne , who appointed him canon of the Cologne Cathedral .

Turning to a more active life , Albert accompanied Emperor Maximilian I to Italy in 1508 , and after his return spent some time in the Kingdom of Hungary . # Grand Master # Duke Frederick of Saxony , Grand Master of the Teutonic Order , died in December 1510 . Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle , Sigismund I the Old , Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland , would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia , which had been held by the Order under Polish suzerainty since the Second Peace of Thorn ( 1466 ) . The new Grand Master , aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy , refused to submit to the crown of Poland . As war over the Order 's existence appeared inevitable , Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland , culminated in a war which began in December 1519 and devastated Prussia . Albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521 . The dispute was referred to Emperor Charles V and other princes , but as no settlement was reached Albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war . For this purpose he visited the Diet of Nuremberg in 1522 , where he made the acquaintance of the Reformer Andreas Osiander , by whose influence Albert was won over to Protestantism . The Grand Master then journeyed to Wittenberg , where he was advised by Martin Luther to abandon the rules of his Order , to marry , and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself . This proposal , which was understandably appealing to Albert , had already been discussed by some of his relatives ; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously , and he assured Pope Adrian VI that he was anxious to reform the Order and punish the knights who had adopted Lutheran doctrines . Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians , while Albert 's brother , Margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach , laid the scheme before their uncle , Sigismund I the Old of Poland . # Duke in Prussia # After some delay Sigismund assented to the offer , with the provision that Prussia should be treated as a Polish fiefdom ; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at Krakw , Albert pledged a personal oath to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 February 1525 . The Estates of the land then met at Knigsberg ( Kaliningrad ) and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke , who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther . This transition did not , however , take place without protest . Summoned before the imperial court of justice , Albert refused to appear and was proscribed , while the Order elected a new Grand Master , Walter von Cronberg , who received Prussia as a fief at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing the tumult of the Reformation , the German Peasants ' War , and the wars against the Ottoman Turks , they did not enforce the ban on the duke , and agitation against him soon died away . In imperial politics Albert was fairly active . Joining the League of Torgau in 1526 , he acted in unison with the Protestants , and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the Augsburg Interim in May 1548 . For various reasons , however , poverty and personal inclination among others , he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period . The early years of Albert 's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous . Although he had some trouble with the peasantry , the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court . He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life .

Albert also paid for the printing of the Astronomical Prutenic Tables compiled by Erasmus Reinhold and the first maps of Prussia by Caspar Hennenberger . This step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert 's reign . Osiander 's divergence from Luther 's doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with Philip Melanchthon , who had adherents in Knigsberg , and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town . The duke strenuously supported Osiander , and the area of the quarrel soon broadened . There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles , the burden of taxation was heavy , and Albert 's rule became unpopular . After Osiander 's death in 1552 , Albert favoured a preacher named Johann Funck , who , with an adventurer named Paul Skali , exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense . The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should that happen , to appoint a regent , as his only son , Albert Frederick was still a mere youth . The duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander , and the climax came in 1566 when the Estates appealed to King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland , Albert 's cousin , who sent a commission to Knigsberg . Skali saved his life by flight , but Funck was executed . The question of the regency was settled , and a form of Lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers . Virtually deprived of power , the duke lived for two more years , and died at Tapiau on 20 March 1568 . Cornelis Floris de Vriendt designed his tomb within Knigsberg Cathedral . Albert was a voluminous letter writer , and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time . # Legacy # Although Albert has received relatively little recognition in German history , his dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia , which would eventually become arguably the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albert is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of Germany . He was a skilled political administrator and leader , and effectively reversed the decline of the Teutonic Order , until he betrayed it by transforming the order 's lands into his own duchy , secularizing it in the process . Albert was the first German noble to support Luther 's ideas and in 1544 founded the University of Knigsberg , the Albertina , as a rival to the Roman Catholic Cracow Academy . It was the second Lutheran university in the German states , after the University of Marburg . A relief of Albert over the Renaissance-era portal of Knigsberg Castle 's southern wing was created by Andreas Hess in 1551 according to plans by Christoph Rmer . Another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the Albertina 's original campus .

On 19 May 1891 Reusch premiered a famous statue of Albert at Knigsberg Castle with the inscription : Albert of Brandenburg , Last Grand Master , First Duke in Prussia . Albert Wolff also designed an equestrian statue of Albert located at the new campus of the Albertina . King 's Gate contains a statue of Albert . Albert was oft-honored in the quarter Maraunenhof in northern Knigsberg . Its main street was named Herzog-Albrecht-Allee in 1906 .

Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits , including resistance to pests and to herbicides . Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries . GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects , impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow .

In 2012 the EU was reported to import 30 million tons a year of GM crops , but such imports remain controversial . Cultivation of herbicide-resistant corn in the EU provides substantial farm-level benefits . # Insecticide-producing corn # Bt corn is a variant of maize that has been genetically altered to express one or more proteins from the Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria . The protein is poisonous to certain insect pests and is widely used in organic gardening . The European corn borer causes about a billion dollars in damage to corn crops each year .

The theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide .

Prior to the enactment of the Local Government ( Dublin ) Act 1993 , the county was a unified whole even though it was administered by two local authorities - Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation . Since the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001 in particular , the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of county and a further entity at the level of city . They rank equally as first level local administrative units of the NUTS 3 Dublin Region for Eurostat purposes . There are 34 LAU 1 entities in the Republic of Ireland .

To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region ( ' ' ' ' ) and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority . The area lost its administrative county status in 1994 , with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ' ' Local Government ( Dublin ) Act , 1993 ' ' stating that the county shall cease to exist .

Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region , the term County Dublin is still in common usage . Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a County Dublin or Dublin Region basis . The area formerly known as County Dublin is now defined in legislation solely as the Dublin Region under the ' ' Local Government Act , 1991 ( Regional Authorities ) ( Establishment ) Order , 1993 ' ' , and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area .

This resulted in the economy of the county expanding by almost 100% between the early 1990s and 2007 . This growth resulted from incoming high-value industries , such as financial services and software manufacturing , as well as low-skilled retail and domestic services , which caused a shift away from older manufacturing-industry . This change saw high unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s which resulted in damage to the capitals social structure .

@@9514 Edvard Hagerup Grieg ( ; 15 June 1843 4 September 1907 ) was a Norwegian composer and pianist . He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers , and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide . His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum , as well as helping develop a national identity , much as Jean Sibelius and Antonn Dvok did in Finland and Bohemia respectively . # Biography # Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born in Bergen , Norway , on 15 June 1843 . His parents were Alexander Grieg ( 18061875 ) , a merchant and vice-consul in Bergen ; and Gesine Judithe Hagerup ( 18141875 ) , a music teacher and daughter of Edvard Hagerup . The family name , originally spelled Greig , has Scottish origins . After the Battle of Culloden in 1746 , Grieg 's great-grandfather , Alexander Greig , traveled widely , settling in Norway about 1770 , and establishing business interests in Bergen . Edvard Grieg was raised in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taught him to play at the age of six . Grieg studied in several schools , including Tanks Upper School , Tanks School and the N.P.S , Norwegian Private School . In the summer of 1858 , Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist Ole Bull , who was a family friend ; Bull 's brother was married to Grieg 's aunt . Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy 's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the Leipzig Conservatory , the piano department of which was directed by Ignaz Moscheles . Grieg enrolled in the conservatory , concentrating on the piano , and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in Leipzig . He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study . An exception was the organ , which was mandatory for piano students . In the spring of 1860 , he survived a life-threatening lung disease , pleurisy and tuberculosis . Throughout his life , Grieg 's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine . He suffered from numerous respiratory infections , and ultimately developed combined lung and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanatoria both in Norway and abroad . Several of his doctors became his personal friends . In 1861 , Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in Karlshamn , Sweden . In 1862 , he finished his studies in Leipzig and held his first concert in his home town , where his programme included Beethoven 's ' ' Pathtique ' ' sonata . In 1863 , Grieg went to Copenhagen , Denmark , and stayed there for three years . He met the Danish composers J. P. E. Hartmann and Niels Gade . He also met his fellow Norwegian composer Rikard Nordraak ( composer of the Norwegian national anthem ) , who became a good friend and source of inspiration . Nordraak died in 1866 , and Grieg composed a funeral march in his honor . On 11 June 1867 , Grieg married his first cousin , Nina Hagerup . The next year , their only child , Alexandra , was born . Alexandra died in 1869 from meningitis . In the summer of 1868 , Grieg wrote his Piano Concerto in A minor while on holiday in Denmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 April 1869 in the Casino Theater in Copenhagen . Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in Christiania ( as Oslo was then named ) . In 1868 , Franz Liszt , who had not yet met Grieg , wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education , which led to Grieg 's obtaining a travel grant . The two men met in Rome in 1870 . On Grieg 's first visit , they went over Grieg 's Violin Sonata No. 1 , which pleased Liszt greatly . On his second visit , in April , Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto , which Liszt proceeded to sightread ( including the orchestral arrangement ) . Liszt 's rendition greatly impressed his audience , although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly . Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on orchestration , ( for example , to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet ) . In 187476 , Grieg composed incidental music for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' , at the request of the author . Grieg had close ties with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra ( Harmonien ) , and later became Music Director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882 . In 1888 , Grieg met Tchaikovsky in Leipzig . Grieg was struck by the sadness in Tchaikovsky. cite web Grieg was awarded two honorary doctorates , first by Cambridge University in 1894 and the next from Oxford University in 1906. # Later years # The Norwegian government provided him with a pension . In the spring 1903 , Grieg made nine 78-rpm gramophone recordings of his piano music in Paris ; all of these historic discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs , despite limited fidelity . Grieg also made live-recording player piano music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and Welte-Mignon reproducing system , all of which survive today and can be heard . He also worked with the Aeolian Company for its ' Autograph Metrostyle ' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces . In 1906 , he met the composer and pianist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grieg 's music and a strong empathy was quickly established . In a 1907 interview , Grieg stated : I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play , and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played ! He is a genius that we Scandinavians can not do other than love . Edvard Grieg died in the late summer of 1907 , aged 64 , after a long period of illness . His final words were Well , if it must be so . The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people out on the streets of his home town to honor him . Following his wish , his own ' ' Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak ' ' was played in an orchestration by his friend Johan Halvorsen , who had married Grieg 's niece . In addition , the ' ' Funeral March ' ' movement from Chopin 's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played . Grieg was cremated , and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house , Troldhaugen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edvard Grieg and his wife considered themselves Unitarians and Nina went to the Unitarian church in Copenhagen after his death . # Music # Some of Grieg 's early works include a symphony ( which he later suppressed ) and a piano sonata . He also wrote three violin sonatas and a cello sonata . Grieg also composed the incidental music for Henrik Ibsen 's play , Peer Gynt - which includes the famous excerpt entitled , In the Hall of the Mountain King . In this piece of music , the adventures of the anti-hero , Peer Gynt , are related , including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding . The angry guests chase him , and Peer falls , hitting his head on a rock . He wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls . The music of In the Hall of the Mountain King represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats . The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain . In an 1874 letter to his friend Frants Beyer , Grieg expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the movement he composed for Peer Gynt , writing I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King something that I literally ca n't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies , exaggerated Norwegian nationalism , and trollish self-satisfaction ! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible . Grieg 's ' ' Holberg Suite ' ' was originally written for the piano , and later arranged by the composer for string orchestra . Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets Heinrich Heine , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Henrik Ibsen , Hans Christian Andersen , Rudyard Kipling and others . Russian composer Nikolai Myaskovsky used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet . Norwegian pianist Eva Knardahl recorded the composer 's complete piano music during 1978 and 1980 . The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs by BIS Records .

Honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've knocked some sense into me because I ended up having a little chat with my conscience , you know -- smug , self-righteous , Jiminy Cricket wannabe . And I -- and I -- I -- I realized something very important . @!Dixie: What 's that ? @!Tad: As satisfying as killing David Hayward would be , it 's just not worth risking what you and I have together . See , I never want to give anybody that much power over you and me , especially not David . He 's just not worth it . # @!Brooke: Edmund ? How is Laura ? Has there been any change ? @!Edmund: Jake 's still examining her . @!Brooke: I want to see her . @!Edmund: Where 's Leo ? @!Brooke: I have no idea . Laura . @!Jake: Brooke . @!Brooke: Honey , honey , how are you doing ? How is she , Jake ? @!Jake: Well , better than when she came in . @!Laura: Mom . Where 's Leo ? I need him . Just tell me where he is . @(Laura-wheezes) @!Brooke: Honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the airport . @!Laura: But , Mom , you have to find him . I need him . I need Leo here . @!Brooke: It 's all right . We 'll find him , we 'll find him . It 's okay . @!Jake: Okay , okay . We 're doing our best to track Leo down and I want you just to relax , Laura , and I 'm going to step outside and talk to your mom . @!Laura: No , I do n't want to relax ! I want Leo ! @!Brooke: I know . I know you do . Honey , I understand , all right ? I 'm just going to be right outside . I 'm just going to -- I 'm just going to talk to Jake for a minute , okay ? I 'll be right back . Jake , what -- what is wrong ? Is it her heart ? I mean , she was doing so well . @!Jake: Look , Brooke , physically , Laura is doing fine . Have a seat . Her heartbeat was slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have found . @!Brooke: But something is wrong . I mean , she 's so agitated . I 'd really like it if Dr . Hayward could look at her . @!Jake: Okay , well , Dr . Hayward has been paged . @!Brooke: Okay . @!Jake: But I do n't think she needs to see a cardiologist . At this point , I would recommend a psychiatrist . # @!Liza: How could you side with him ? @!Ryan: You quote me and I 'll deny it , but , Liza , this time he 's right . @!Adam: I do n't need you to defend me , Lavery . @!Ryan: Shut it , Chandler ! Liza , you set out the ground rules , right ? I mean , Adam 's got to follow the game plan . One false move and he 's history . @!Liza: That is not exactly -- @!Ryan: Well , you pretty much rigged it so he ca n't win , Liza . @!Liza: No , he 's good and he can succeed . @!Ryan: You gave him a list of do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . @!Liza: So ? @!Ryan: So what 's he supposed to do ? Sit home and wait for you to decide whether , you know , you want to come back ? He ca n't do that . He 's got to take action . He 's a shark . He swims or he dies . @!Liza: Well , so -- so what , the great white swims up to your doorstep ? @!Ryan: Right . And he finds you in a motel room with a guy . @!Liza: Yeah . @!Ryan: The same -- the same guy that he caught you in bed with . @!Liza: And he jumps to the conclusion that I 'm having another affair with you . @!Ryan: Liza , look at this from his point of view . It did n't look so innocent . @!Adam: Are you finished ? @!Ryan: Almost . Where were you going to go when you left here , Liza ? @!Liza: Home . @!Ryan: Well , then follow the game plan and go home . @!Adam: Liza -- @!Liza: I 'm not going to fight with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Thank you for your perspective . @!Ryan: Later , Adam . Do n't bother thanking me . # @!Indy: So , what is the story with you and Mrs . Leo ? @!Leo: Uh , boring . @!Indy: I also have a high boredom tolerance . @!Leo: Yeah , well , this will send you over the edge , believe me . @!Indy: Try me . @!Leo: Why ? @!Indy: Why not ? Pour your soul out . You 'll never see me again , so any secrets that you want to share are going to disappear with this bar smoke and me . @!Leo: Okay . You asked for it . The story of Leo and how he fell into a marriage and what happened after that . I -- well , I 've been around the world and tried everything , so I thought I 'd take a stab at being the good guy/husband type . @!Indy: And what happened ? @!Leo: I was n't right for the part . I kept forgetting my lines and what was supposed to do . It just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like that ? @!Leo: Mm-hmm . Just like that . Never looked back , on to the next adventure . You up for it ? @!Indy: Oh , I 'm up for anything . I 'm just not so sure that you are . @!Leo: Try me . @!Indy: You 're a real B.S . artist , Leo -- not that there 's anything wrong with that . @!Leo: What do you mean ? @!Indy: I mean I 've been around the world just like you and this whole guy-without-a-heart routine -- it 's the worst thing I 've seen since I hit New York . # @!Brooke: Jake , why do you think Laura needs psychiatric help ? @!Jake: Well , Brooke , it seems to me that Laura has worked herself up into a major panic attack . @!Brooke: A panic attack ? @!Jake: She shows all of the symptoms -- uncontrolled anxiety , rapid , shallow breathing , accelerated heartbeat . # @!Phoebe: What 's bothering you , Sweetheart ? @!Laura: Nothing . @!Phoebe: Well , now , you can not fool Dear Aggie , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Laura: Well , I do n't know . Maybe it 's this whole marriage thing . How do you know when you 're a good wife ? @!Phoebe: Well , have you gotten any complaints ? @!Laura: Not really . I mean , Leo says everything 's fine . @!Phoebe: But you do n't believe him ? @!Laura: I just thought things would be different -- like once you 're married , things would fall into place . @!Phoebe: Oh , no , Darling . Marriage is n't the end of the journey . In fact , it 's only the starting point . @!Laura: Did you and Uncle Langley -- did you guys have problems when you first got married ? @!Phoebe: Did we ever . You see , every marriage has a period of adjustment . You and Leo are only getting to know one another . @!Laura: I know . I just feel like I 'm trying so hard to be what I think he wants . @!Phoebe: Romantic ? @!Laura: And I feel like it 's making him -- both of us -- too self-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not if I keep saying the wrong thing , not if we keep fighting . @!Phoebe: Oh , you 'll fight , all right . But then you 'll make up and that , believe me , is the best part . @!Laura: I hope you 're right . @!Phoebe: Of course I 'm right . @(Alarm-clock-rings) @!Laura: Oh -- time for my meds . @!Phoebe: Time for mine , too . Thanks for the reminder . @!Laura: Oh , really ? Popping pills with my great aunt -- how weird is that ? What are yours for ? @!Phoebe: Oh , they slow down my heart rate . @!Laura: Really ? @!Phoebe: Mm-hmm . @!Laura: Is that bad ? @!Phoebe: Well , when it 's my age , it is . @!Laura: You 're not old , Aunt Phoebe . @!Phoebe: Well , I ca n't turn cartwheels any longer , but I 've learned a few things over the years . Just be patient , darling . @!Laura: I 'm trying . @!Phoebe: Good . I hope I 've helped . @!Laura: Oh . You 've helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Laura: Hmm . # @!Dixie: Well , Honey , I 'm relieved that you want to cross David off your hit list . @!Tad: Well , he 's a complete waste of time . @!Dixie: But I think it 's obvious he still pushes your buttons . @!Tad: Well , baby , I 'd like to think it 's not just me . You know , you should have seen the way he went after my father . He makes him sound like a hazard to his patients . I 've never seen Pop look so devastated . @!Dixie: But everybody knows what a great doctor Joe is . Say he does have to go in front of the board for some reason . He 's going to have the entire hospital staff behind him . @!Tad: Yeah , well , what if Hayward gets to them first ? @!Dixie: There 's a lot of people who would like to see David take a fall . Maybe I could even help give him a little push . @!Tad: Yeah ? Really ? Why ? @!Dixie: Well -- @!Tad: What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of friends when I was working for the Andrassy Foundation . @!Tad: Yeah ? @!Dixie: I could call them up , you know , schmooze them a little bit , tell them how PVH would n't be the great hospital that it is today without Joe 's dedication and leadership . @!Tad: Baby , that 's brilliant . That 's -- hmm , yes ! And you know what ? If we wanted to , we could even start our own little smear campaign against , you know , Dr . Diablo . @!Dixie: Hang on a second , okay ? David is his own worst press agent . Nobody is going to support him over Joe . @!Tad: I wish I had your belief in human nature . @!Dixie: Well , stick with me ; I 'll bring you around . @!Tad: Yeah . @!Dixie: I 'm going to get on this , okay ? Are you going to be all right ? @!Tad: Yeah , yeah , I 'm sure -- fine . I 'm just , you know , waiting for my discharge papers . @!Dixie: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? @!Dixie: For being so good , not letting David control you . I 'm proud of you . @!Tad: Thank you . @!Jesse: Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk . @!Tad: Listen , you , I want whatever you are out of my noggin , okay ? So you just , you know , be gone . @!Jesse: Oh , do n't be dumb , Tad . You need me now more than ever . @!Tad: No . @!Jesse: Yes , you do . @!Tad: No , no , no . I do n't see -- look , hey , look , I 'm fine . I 'm not going after Hayward . @!Jesse: Boy , you must really think I 'm stupid , huh ? # @!Dixie: Jake , Jake . @!Jake: Hey . @!Dixie: I 'm looking for David Hayward . @!Jake: Well , that makes two of us . @!Dixie: Tad told me he 's trying to oust Joe as Chief of Staff ? @!Jake: Yeah , yeah , it appears that way and that 's what 's got Tad so ticked off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . Does he have a case ? @!Jake: He thinks so . @!Dixie: Somebody 's got to talk to that man . @!Jake: Oh , and that someone would be you ? @!Dixie: Why not ? @!Jake: You know why . @!Dixie: I 'm not going to let him get to me . Honestly , Jake . Where do you think he is , anyway ? @!Jake: I do n't know , beats me , but he 's got a patient waiting for a consult and he 's nowhere to be found . @!Dixie: Great . Well , he ca n't hide from me . # @!Brooke: You did n't seem surprised when Jake recommended that Laura get some psychiatric help . @!Edmund: You may want to consider that . @!Brooke: Well , I mean , why do you think that she needs psychiatric help ? @!Edmund: Brooke , I was at the office when Laura lost it . @!Brooke: Well , do you have any idea what set her off ? @!Edmund: No . Well , I 'm not sure , but she fired that temporary secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was harsh . @!Brooke: She 's not like this , all right ? I do n't understand any of this . @!Edmund: She 's had a pretty rough time since the , you know , transplant . @!Brooke: Leo said before I left for Switzerland that she seemed down . @!Edmund: Leo ? He 's been kind of the focus of her frustration . I 've left messages all over . Where is he , Brooke ? @!Brooke: When I came back from the airport , I stopped over at Laura and Leo 's condo . He was n't there , but I found -- @!Laura: Mom ! Oh , help me ! @!Brooke: Jake ? @!Jake: I heard . Laura , what is it ? @!Laura: I do n't know . I just got so dizzy all of a sudden . @!Jake: Look , just relax , just relax . @!Laura: What 's wrong with me , Jake ? @!Jake: We 're going to find out . Just relax and take deep breaths . @!Brooke: All right , all right , honey . All right , I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm right here , okay ? @!Jake: Deep breaths . # @!Adam: Colby grew while you two were gone . @!Liza: Oh , we were n't gone that long . @!Adam: Yeah , well , she 's -- she 's different somehow . @!Liza: Except when she 's sleeping . @!Adam: Yeah . With that stud lion tucked under her chin , her beautiful hair . Almost as beautiful as her mother . @!Liza: The way you look at her never changes . Watching you watching her sleeping makes me fall in love with you all over again . @!Adam: And then we tiptoe down the steps and the spell is broken . @!Liza: Is it ? @!Adam: Yes , we retreat to our separate corners ; you draw a line in the sand , and dare me to cross it . If I do , well , I 'm a control freak . And if I do n't , I -- I do n't know who I am or what the hell we 're doing here . @!Liza: I thought we were trying to make our marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that your first priority ? @!Liza: What do you think ? @!Adam: I do n't know . First thing you did when you came home was race over to Ryan 's house . @!Liza: There was a reason for that . @!Adam: What , to drive me over the edge ? @!Liza: No , you knew I needed to get away . @!Adam: To punish me ? @!Liza: No , to figure out where we go next . @!Adam: What the hell does Ryan Lavery have to do with our future ? @!Liza: If you would just stop this just for a minute , I would tell you because , Adam , I have made a very important decision about us . @!Adam: So you 've made a decision about us ? @!Liza: Yes . @!Adam: Do I need a drink or a blindfold ? @!Liza: Will you just let me talk ? I realize that , with everything , that I 've lost sight of what 's most important in my life . I mean , even though Colby is the center of my world -- you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of you in the yearbook ? And under that picture sometimes it 's written " most likely to " whatever . To succeed in business , to get married , to become a millionaire . @!Adam: Uh-huh , yes . @!Liza: Well , under my high school photo , it said " Most likely to be a home-wrecker . " @!Adam: That was cruel . @!Liza: It was accurate . I was n't a very good person . I was as ruthless as you are . @!Adam: That 's not a compliment , I take it ? @!Liza: It 's just -- I 'm just stating a fact . I did n't want to grow up to be that girl in my high school yearbook , known for sleeping around . But when I left home , I looked in the mirror and I was that girl , only the home that I was wrecking was my own . @!Adam: But you still left . @!Liza: I came back . @!Adam: Why ? @!Liza: Because I missed here , I missed you . Our battles , the backhanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why you came home ? @!Liza: It was you . Something you said , you took me back to that time , and I do n't want to be my mother 's daughter . I do n't want to be that kind of mother for Colby . @!Adam: But you went to see Ryan first . @!Liza: I had to make peace for what I did , for turning to him . @!Adam: And did you ? @!Liza: Yes , we did , we both did . Ryan has to find his own way . I do n't -- I do n't want to lose you . I do n't want our marriage to be over . @!Adam: What do you want ? @!Liza: I want you to hold me . I want you to wrap your arms around me and just be with me all night . I want to be in my husband 's bed . # @!Tad: Oh , for God 's sake . Is n't there a castle in Scotland somewhere you can go haunt ? @!Jesse: Oh , shut up , Tad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this dog ai n't biting . @!Tad: What line ? @!Jesse: That you 're going to give Hayward a pass . Ha ! @!Tad: Why 's that so unbelievable ? @!Jesse: Because I saw you with that damn hammer in your hand and that Charles Manson look in your eye . @!Tad: Okay , okay . Jesse , I swear to God -- @!Jesse: Uh-uh-uh-uh . Do n't swear . Does n't sit too well with the big cheese , you know ? @!Tad: Oh , this is ridiculous . You know , you 're not real . I 'm not even having this conversation . @!Jesse: I am real . And I 'm here trying to keep your butt out of trouble . @!Tad: I told you , I 'm not in trouble . @!Jesse: You will be if you go after Hayward . Now , Tad , if this man is half as bad as you say he is , trust me , he 's going to have more then enough to deal with when his time comes . @!Tad: What 's your point ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there really is a -- a down there ? @!Jesse: Tad , we go way back , and I would really like to cut you some slack . @!Tad: No , do n't tell me . I know . I 've seen " It 's A Wonderful Life . " You do n't do your little good deed , you do n't get your wings , right ? @!Jesse: Oh , it ai n't the wings I 'm after , trust me . It 's the powers that be . I mean , they -- they think you still need me around . Otherwise , I 'd be chilling with Jenny . @!Tad: Jenny ? @!Jesse: Jenny . Yeah , she 's a bigger angel there than she was here . @!Tad: Can she see me ? @!Jesse: Hell , yeah , she 's right there . Psych . Made you look . You know , Tad , seriously , it would break Jenny 's heart if you killed the maniac doctor and the both of you-all ended up sharing bunks in that place you call hell . # @!Edmund: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @!Jake: Well , there 's a new development . I ran another ECG . @!Brooke: And ? @!Jake: And Laura 's heart rate has decelerated abnormally . @!Edmund: Hmm . @!Brooke: Well , what -- what would cause that ? @!Jake: Any number of possibilities . We 're just going to have to run more tests to see . @!Brooke: Oh . So , well , then she did n't have a panic attack ? @!Jake: Apparently not . @!Brooke: Do you think she still needs psychiatric help ? @!Jake: I do n't think it would hurt , but the need is not immediate . But I am sorry for alarming you unnecessarily . @!Brooke: Can I see her ? @!Jake: Well , actually , Laura just fell asleep , but before she nodded off , she did say that she wanted to see Leo . @!Brooke: All right , listen , thank you , Jake . @!Jake: Okay . @!Brooke: So -- so she did n't just have a panic attack . @!Edmund: Well , apparently not . This is good news , yes ? @!Brooke: Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having a breakdown . I just -- you know , I just want to know what is going on with her heart rate . @!Edmund: The doctors will find out , okay ? @!Brooke: Okay . @!Edmund: I 'm sure Laura 's going to be all right . @!Brooke: I hope you 're right . @!Edmund: You going to be all right ? @!Brooke: I 'll be okay . @!Edmund: Got to make a call .

He has friends here . Adam is here . You 're here . @!Tad: Is that the problem ? Are you going to Europe to get away from me ? @!Dixie: No . @!Tad: Good , I 'm glad to hear it . So do n't go . He 's clearly upset . Just postpone your trip . @!Dixie: This is n't some whim , okay ? I 've given this a lot of thought . I need to discover who I am again . I need to be alone . @!Tad: Okay , okay , do n't , you know , lose your temper . @!Dixie: Well , I ca n't help it . This is just not going the way I planned . @!Tad: Maybe because you 're not being honest . @!Dixie: You do n't have to make it harder on me . @!Tad: I do n't see how I can . Do you honestly expect me to believe you 're going to leave your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go off and find yourself ? Maybe we should , you know , take this from the top . @!Dixie: If you 're not going to believe me , what can I do ? @!Tad: You can tell me the truth . Why would you leave ? # @!Leo: If I could pitch Vanessa into hell right now , I swear to God I would . What , do you think I 'm going to hit her ? Greenlee , I would never hit you . @!Greenlee: I know you would n't . @!Leo: Why am I even upset or -- or surprised ? I mean , it 's just Vanessa being Vanessa , right ? So , tell me , Jake , what was it like having nice , normal parents growing up , huh ? @!Jake: I was lucky , Leo . @!Leo: You had two parents who cared about you and encouraged you , not for what you could do for them but because they loved you , right ? What a concept . @!Greenlee: Leo , it 's not your fault that Vanessa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my fault that I did n't break away from her years ago . @!Greenlee: She 's insidious . @!Leo: I was her accomplice from the day I was born , Greenlee . She used me as a pawn to play people for money , getting sympathy by dangling me in front of people before I could even talk . @!Greenlee: But she ca n't do that anymore . @!Leo: No , she 's -- conning people is our special game . We actually invented stories , stealing from nice , caring people . @!Greenlee: You got past that . @!Leo: When I came to Pine Valley , I distanced myself from her . When she killed Paolo and tried to blame it on me , that -- that was it between us . It was over . But I guess I just did n't cut myself off enough from her as much as I should have . @!Greenlee: Do n't do this to yourself , Leo . @!Leo: She cried and she trembled . I went running back for damage control . I mean , she -- I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she killed him . @!Greenlee: You did n't know . @!Leo: Well , I did n't know that Larry 's body was in the trunk after I tried to take it out to her car or whatever . But I knew she was toxic . So why did I keep getting suckered in ? @!Greenlee: Because she 's your mother . @!Leo: Well , she 's David 's mother , too , and he wanted to send her off into a padded cell , but not me . I was so convinced that she did n't do it that I convinced him not to do it . She denied killing Larry . The cops dropped the charges , and I believed her story . @!Jake: Leo , do you know that your mother killed that guy now ? @!Leo: I 'd imagine that she drugged Larry the same way she drugged Paolo and you and Greenlee . You know , if I just would have figured all this out earlier , Larry and Paolo might still be alive . And we might be at home , getting ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it to me again . She did it to me again . My whole -- @(Leo-yells) # @!Erica: Oh , my God ! Chris ! Chris ! @!Kendall: Ryan , were you hurt ? @!Ryan: No , no , just Chris . @!Erica: Chris ? Can you speak to me ? Chris , stay with me . Chris , stay with me . Oh . Okay . Okay . You 're going to be all right . You 're going to be all right . Kendall , call 911 ! Get an ambulance ! @!Kendall: Okay . @!Ryan: Is he going to be all right ? Is he -- @!Erica: Yes , he 's going to be all right . He 's breathing . He 's going to be fine . It 's just the loss of blood . He lost some blood , that 's all . Chris , you 're going to be fine . @!Ryan: The shot came from over here someplace . @!Erica: No , Ryan , we do n't need you to be hurt , too . @!Ryan: We 'd all be dead if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went after him , he 's gone . Oh , my God ! @!Ryan: Take it easy . It 's all right . He 's going to be okay .

Well , I 'm going to have some seltzer . You want any ? @!Dixie: No , thank you . @!Tad: Okay . Go ahead . I 'm ready . @!Dixie: Okay . The last few years have been rather difficult , agreed ? @!Tad: Oh , yeah . @!Dixie: I 'm not trying to erase the past . I 'm simply trying to rise above it . @!Tad: Okay . @!Dixie: I want to feel free to explore what I want to do with my life . What ? @!Tad: Why do I feel like I 'm about to be attacked by Dr . Phil ? @!Dixie: Maybe you deserve it . @!Tad: Yeah , I guess maybe I do . So , by all means , go on . You were saying that you 're leaving to nurture your inner child . @!Dixie: Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Tad: I 'm sorry . Move over . Come on . I 'm just trying to make sense of this . @!Dixie: Well , maybe you 're not supposed to make sense of it . Maybe you 're just supposed to accept it . @!Tad: I am supposed to -- if I do n't understand what 's going on , you ca n't hold it against me . You know something ? You 've been all over the map lately . I mean , honestly , what was that little , you know , field trip down to the islands there , you know , for our guerrilla divorce ? Was n't that supposed to give you some sense of closure ? @!Dixie: Well , was that before or after I nearly died ? Look , the last year , we both learned how precious and fleeting life can be . @!Tad: Yes , absolutely . So , by all means , you know , turn your back on everything you know to hop across the pond . @!Dixie: It 's not your call . It 's my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking about J.R . @!Tad: Yeah , I know , I know . This is the part where you tell me that he 's your son , not mine , right ? @!Dixie: I was not going to say that . @!Tad: For God 's sake , Dixie , think about it . Do you really have to go halfway around the world to do a little soul-searching ? Is n't that a bit strange ? @!Dixie: You know , I do n't need you questioning every move I make , ridiculing my decisions . You do n't have any right , and I have the divorce papers to prove it . @!Tad: You 're right . @!Dixie: No -- @!Tad: No , no , you 're absolutely right . @!Dixie: I 'm sorry . I do n't want to fight . @!Tad: I do n't , either . You remember the last time we were alone together in this room ? We did n't fight then . @!Dixie: No , we did n't . @!Tad: Kind of ironic , do n't you think ? I 'd actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court date for our divorce hearing . @!Dixie: Yeah , I remember . @!Tad: One minute you were crying , I was holding you , and the next minute I 'm kissing you . It was too bad . You know , for a moment there , one beautiful moment , I was convinced the divorce was never going to be a part of future , that we managed to make some kind of fresh , wonderful start . We always used to be able to handle whatever life handed to us , together . # @!Leo: You owe me , Jake . @!Jake: I do ? @!Leo: Yeah . Well , look where you are , thanks to me . Who you 've got in your arms , thanks to me and my mother . You know , it would n't surprise me one bit if -- just forget it . @!Jake: Greenlee , just give him a chance to cool off . @!Leo: What 's that ? Did you say something to me , Jake ? @!Jake: No , Leo , I did n't . But if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since I seem to have your attention , I 'm going to let you know right now -- your mother 's going to get what she deserves . When we get back to Pine Valley , I 'm going straight to the police . # @!Ryan: Looks like there 's a little less blood . I think the wound 's slowed down a little bit . @!Erica: Oh , God ! Kendall , where 's the ambulance ? @!Kendall: I 'll call again . @(Car-approaches) @!Erica: Oh , thank God ! They 're here ! Hang on , Darling . Help 's here . @!David: What 's going on ? @!Erica: You 're going to be okay . Chris Stamp was shot ! @!Mateo: You know what 's going on ! He gets shot , and you just happen on the scene ? @!David: Let me see what I can do for him . Somebody get my medical bag ! It 's in the back seat of my car ! @!Anna: David 's not involved in this . @!Mateo: He 's not involved ? @!Anna: No . @!Mateo: It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Anna: No . I 've been with him all night . We were on our way over here to tell Chris that we do have a solid lead on Proteus . @!Mateo: He could have ordered the hit . @!Anna: He did n't order the hit . What are you talking about ? He 's not Proteus . I ca n't prove it to you , but I will . Please , just trust me on this one . Did you see which direction the shots came from ? @!Mateo: Over by that alley . Come on . @!Erica: Yes . Yes , Dr . David Hayward is with him now . And he needs a -- @!David: Thoracotomy set . @!Erica: A thoracotomy set . He needs a thoracotomy set in the ambulance . Please , tell them to hurry . Please hurry . @!Ryan: Wait a second , what 's that for ? @!David: The bullet must have grazed his heart . @!Erica: No ! @!David: It tore one of its vessels . @!Ryan: Is that bad ?

Stay away from him . @!Leo: I said I would n't hit you . I never mentioned him . @!Jake: Leo , that 's the only free shot you 're ever going to get with me . If we try to kill each other , we 're never going to get off this island . @!Leo: Oh , you got it all figured out , do n't you ? What , are you going to save us all now , Jake ? @!Greenlee: Have you lost your mind ? @!Leo: No , worse -- I lost you . And you got what you 've been looking for for months , did n't you ? @!Greenlee: First , you 're violent , now -- go , Leo . Get off my island . @!Leo: This is the answer to all your prayers , right , Jake ? Vanessa targets you both , and not only am I the bad guy with the mother from hell , but now you get to play the hero again , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Leo: Oh , you know , it would n't surprise me one bit if you worked on Vanessa with this one , you know , staged it . @!Greenlee: Jake cares about me . @!Leo: Well , of course he says that , Greenlee . @!Greenlee: It 's the truth . I was n't his mark , and I love him for that . @!Leo: So , did you question it every time I said I loved you ? You know , the way we started out ? Is that why you ran to him every time we hit a rough patch ? We never had a chance . @!Greenlee: Leo -- @!Leo: No , just leave me alone , okay ? I get the picture now . I get it . @!Jake: Green -- let him go this time . @!Greenlee: I guess I better . # @!Tad: It 's always been my dream -- is to be with you . Finally , I thought we had a lock on it . @!Dixie: Until I kicked you out . @!Tad: Well , yeah , that was a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expecting you to give me a second chance . Or third or fourth -- I forget . Which is it ? @!Dixie: You know , I do n't know . @!Tad: Did I really make it so easy to lose count ? I mean , how can two people love each other so much and still lose one another ? @!Dixie: That 's a tough one . @!Tad: Yeah . @!Dixie: Well , Leslie played a part . So did David . @!Tad: Uh-uh . They could n't have torn us apart if we felt strong about each other . The truth is I think what we had had started to fall apart before then . @!Dixie: Maybe . @!Tad: It happened when you were pregnant . Remember , you told me , I freaked out ? @!Dixie: Yeah , you were worried . @!Tad: Worried ? No , I was terrified . Dixie , come on . You know , honestly , the thought of you having a baby ? Carrying a child ? Giving birth ? I mean , with your blood pressure , with your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Dixie: Well , it turned out you did n't have to worry . @!Tad: That 's the problem , is n't it ? Because , after you miscarried -- @!Dixie: Do n't -- you do n't have to say that . @!Tad: Yeah , I do because it 's the truth . It 's the truth . Deep down inside , I was relieved because I knew you could n't be hurt . No , I mean , that you would n't -- you would n't die , that you would be all right . You knew that , did n't you ? @!Dixie: Yeah , I did . @!Tad: And it did n't matter . Because you still have n't forgiven me for it . @!Dixie: I loved our baby . I just did n't understand why you did n't . @!Tad: It 's not a question of loving our baby ; it is a question of loving you , of being terrified of losing you . I did anyway because , to you , I chose you over our baby . That 's when -- that 's when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? Maybe people just change . @!Tad: Well , is there anything I can do about it ? Anything at all ? I mean , is this thing always going to be there between us ? @!Dixie: I do n't think either one of us is ever going to forget it . @!Tad: No . I guess not . Because you know something ? Even if I could change it and go back , you know what I would do ? @!Dixie: You ca n't . You ca n't change it . @!Tad: I would make the same decision . I 'm sorry , but I would . Even knowing what it would do to us , the road it was going to put us on . I would always -- I will always choose your life first . I 'm sorry , honey , but I guess I just love you too damn much . # @!David: We got a gunshot victim here ! Penetrating chest wound . He was tamponading .

So , why were you the target ? @!Ryan: I do n't know . @!Officer: You do n't have any idea why someone would want you dead ? @!Ryan: No . @!Officer: Do you have enemies ? @!Ryan: No . @!Officer: Any disgruntled co-workers ? Employees ? A romance gone south ? @!Ryan: No , everybody just loves me . @!Officer: Somebody squeezed the trigger at one of ours .

I 'd like to them . @!Kendall: Okay . @!Anna: Mateo told me about the disc that Chris was trying to get from you when he got shot . @!Mateo: Yeah , and since that sniper was after you , we 're sure he was on Proteus ' payroll . @!Anna: And he 's probably trying to get after you and the disc . @!Mateo: So give up the disc before anybody -- @!Ryan: Take it . Take it . I want Proteus behind bars . I want him dead . I want anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? @!Erica: I 'm fine . It 's Chris . @!Kendall: Can I get you anything ? @!Erica: Unless you can find somebody who can tell us how Chris ' surgery is going . @!Kendall: He 's real tough . He 'll pull through . @!Erica: He just -- he lost a lot of blood . @!Kendall: They 'll transfuse him . @!Erica: It 's just not fair . He 's such a good man .

Ah , yes , something about my undying love . @!Dixie: Tad , nobody has ever loved me the way you have , but you 're not what I need right now . @!Tad: Well , could n't you at least lie a little , for my sake ? @!Dixie: You see through lies , remember ? @!Tad: Yeah .

Nobody 's -- you know , I got that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , not anymore . So , what decisions do you have to make ? @!Dixie: You know , my decision to go away for a while seems to have upset you and J.R . pretty good . @!Tad: Yeah . You really think now is the time to do something like this ? @!Dixie: Tad , stop it . Do n't try to talk me out of it . @!Tad: I 'm not trying to talk you out of it . I 'm just saying , you know , it 's so soon after -- you nearly died a month ago . @!Dixie: And I 'm fine now , okay ? @!Tad: You should n't be traveling to someplace like Europe alone . @!Dixie: I 'm not going to Europe alone .

Am I understood ? @!Mr-.-Timmins What do you want from me ? @!Vanessa: I want that disc . @!Mr-.-Timmins I told you , it 's -- @!Vanessa: You know , if you do n't find me that disc and get it back , I will hunt you down and shoot you myself . Am I clear ? Huh . @!Vanessa: Do n't you look at me that way . I am not insane . # @!Edmund: Any word on Stamp 's condition ? @!Brooke: Can you believe I 'm totally being frozen out ? @!Edmund: You , frozen ? @!Brooke: Speaking of which -- I know a guy in the morgue , however , who 's going to call me if they bring anybody in , even if it 's a john doe . So I think that Stamp is still alive . @!Edmund: I got to know how the hell this happened . I mean , the Pine Cone with Erica , Kendall , and Ryan ? What was that about ? @!Brooke: Could have been a setup . @!Simone: It was a setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they were n't aiming for Agent Stamp . @!Edmund: What are you talking about ? @!Simone: They wanted to kill Ryan Lavery . @!Brooke: How do you know that ? @!Simone: Because I made it happen . # @!Kendall: See , I thought I knew who my parents were , too , but -- @!Ryan: I really do n't want to talk about this , Kendall . @!Kendall: Okay . It 's just that I know what you 're going through , Ryan . It 's really hard to find out what you thought was true -- what you thought was the only true thing you ever knew at all -- was n't . Is n't . Whatever . @!Bianca: Have you guys heard anything ? @!Kendall: No . She never came out . She 's still in there with him . @!Bianca: And you 've been sitting here all night ? Well , I guess if anything had changed , she would 've come out and said something . @!Kendall: Why do n't you tell her you 're here ? @!Bianca: Mom ? @!Kendall: Who else are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to bother her . @!Kendall: Well , she needs you . @!Bianca: What do you mean ? @!Kendall: She asked for you . @!Bianca: When ? @!Kendall: Last night . I wanted to help her , but she did n't want my help , so she asked for you . I 'm a little rusty on my church history . Is there a Saint Erica , or is she vying for beatification all on her own ? @!Ryan: Kendall , do you ever give up ? # @!Erica: I know why you did what you did . He 's your son . You 'd die for him . @!Erica: Oh . Oh , Chris . Oh , Chris . Oh , thank God . Oh , thank God . @!Erica: Look -- he opened his eyes . @!Nurse: Can you hear me , Agent Stamp ? @!Erica: He 's all right . I mean , he 's going to be all right . Oh , Chris . @!Nurse: Everything seems good . You rest . I 'll page Sr . Martin . @!Erica: Thank you . You gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan is fine . He 's here . He stayed here all night . He 's right outside . @!Chris: Yeah ? He 's -- he 's not hurt ? @!Erica: No . No , you took care of that for him . I 'll go get him , okay ? You wait right here . Oh , of course you 're going to wait right here . He 's awake ! @!Bianca: Yeah . @!Erica: He -- he asked for you , Ryan . @!Bianca: The nurse just told us . @!Erica: Oh , he just -- he just looked right at me , and I just almost fainted myself because -- Ryan , I said he asked for you . @!Ryan: Yeah , I heard you . @!Erica: Well , then , where are you going ? @!Ryan: As far away from this place as I can get . @!Erica: Over my dead body . # @!Vanessa: Oh , my . You 're afraid of me , are n't you ? Answer me , Mary -- @!Maggie: Ow . @!Vanessa: Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh . @!Maggie: Can you just let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , darling , after all you 've heard ? Shh . @!Maggie: But you told me that you do n't kill family . That 's your rule . @!Vanessa: Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Well , I know exactly what I said . But you are tempting me to break my own code here , so -- well , do n't fret yet . @!Maggie: What are you going to do with me ? @(Vanessa-chuckles) @!Vanessa: Well , now , my dear , that one is entirely up to you . # @!David: I do n't think Proteus is living here with my brother and his fiance . @!Anna: Okay . So why are you here , then ? @!David: You first . @!Anna: I was looking for your mother . I thought maybe she came back here . @!David: All right , let 's back up for a minute . Why are you looking for my mother ? Or have you found something ? @!Anna: I had the syringe tested . @!David: Okay . What did you find ? @!Anna: The drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a high dose . @!David: There 's something else . What ? What is it ? @!Anna: Your mother 's fingerprints -- they were the only ones on there , David . I 'm sorry . Vanessa 's Proteus . @!David: You -- you need to get yourself a hobby . @!Anna: David -- @!David: No , no , no , I mean it . Look -- I 'm the last person in the world to defend my mother , but this -- @!Anna: David -- @!David: This -- this -- this is absurd , and you know it . @!Anna: You already said that you thought she was responsible for the death of her chauffeur . @!David: That does n't make her a drug lord ! Come on ! @!Anna: Well , Stamp thinks that she 's Proteus , too . @!David: Oh , oh . Then you know this ? @!Anna: Mateo was attacked in the state pen . Stamp knew that it was going to happen . I already told you that the jail guard that did it , he was -- he died conveniently right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what caused him his heart attack ? @!David: All right , wait , wait -- just -- @!Anna: Traces of the drug that were in the syringe found in here . Now , if they were n't looking for it , they would never have seen it . @!David: She 's my mother , Anna ! @!Anna: I know ! @!David: Look , I know that Vanessa 's a lot of things , but she 's not some methodical , you know , sociopathic -- damn it , come on , Anna ! She ca n't be ! @!Anna: David , I 'm sorry . She is . # @!Maggie: I 've been thinking a lot about what you said , about trying to help Frankie . @!Vanessa: Mm-hmm . I did try . But she let her feelings get in the way , you know . Youthful , natural mistake , but it cost her everything . @!Maggie: Have you ever been in love ? I know that 's a weird question to ask right now , but -- but I agree with you . I think that -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- that she made bad decisions , stupid mistakes . You know , I 've -- I 've never been in love . Not yet . So , what is it like ? @!Vanessa: I 've only ever really loved my sons . @!Maggie: No , I mean -- @!Vanessa: Oh , Mary Margaret , I know exactly what you mean . You 're trying to humanize me , are n't you ? Just get me to have some feelings , to show some feelings . @!Maggie: Oh , do you even have feelings ? @!Vanessa: I feel more in a day than you have your entire life ! Although no one seems to ever take my side . @!Maggie: Oh , that 's not true , because Mom said -- Mom said that -- that you never drove Uncle Charles to his grave . Was she wrong ? @!Vanessa: Well , Charles was weak . He was weak . He was destroying my family . @!Maggie: How ? @!Vanessa: Oh . He was destroying David 's life before it even got started ! And that ungrateful son of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to handle his own home . @!Maggie: So did you make Uncle Charles kill himself ? @!Vanessa: If he had n't pulled that trigger , I would have pulled it for him gladly . And that 's something my ungrateful son will never let me forget . # @!Brooke: Tell us what happened . @!Simone: Look , I have worked my butt off for you guys , and I 'm not even on staff . @!Edmund: I know how hard you 've worked and I know what you 've risked , Simone . @!Simone: You do n't even know what I 've risked , Edmund . @!Edmund: What is that supposed to mean ? @!Brooke: You got emotionally involved with a married man in a very volatile situation . Is that it ? @!Simone: I 've handled this badly , and it 's hard to talk about . @!Brooke: Well , you 've let us in this far . @!Simone: I really fell for Mateo . I did n't see it coming . I thought I could handle it . I did n't . And then when I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left to save face was the story that you guys hired me to do in the first place -- @!Brooke: That got pulled . @!Simone: Yes . @!Edmund: Where does Ryan fit into all this ? @!Simone: I felt discarded , Edmund . And my phone rang . This big New York publisher got wind of what I was doing . @!Edmund: Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Wait , wait -- how would this New York -- @!Brooke: Wait , wait , wait . Let her finish . @!Simone: This woman calls me . Her creds check out , so I thought . Basically she offers me this book deal on the Proteus investigation . @!Edmund: How the hell would she know anything -- @!Simone: All she wanted in return is to be part of the daily updates . @!Brooke: Oh . And that did n't raise a red flag ? @!Simone: Well , sure it did . But I was -- I was hurt and -- and mad . I did n't look close enough at the signs . I started to double agent myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone know anything -- except my New York editor , every night . @!Edmund: Okay . I do n't -- I 'm not sure I want to hear any more where this is headed . @!Brooke: I do . @!Simone: I overheard Mateo and Hayley talking to Chris Stamp about some crucial info evidence that Ryan Lavery had . He had it stashed for them . And I told my editor about it . @!Brooke: Who blew your cover for it ? @!Simone: My editor was Proteus . @!Edmund: What ? @!Simone: Well , either that or high up on the food chain . I mean , all I know now is that once I did that , I might as well have painted a red bull's-eye on Ryan Lavery 's chest . And then when they did n't hit him and they hit Chris Stamp -- I mean , I caused this whole thing . @!Edmund: I trusted you more than I 've trusted some of the best reporters I have . @!Simone: I know . @!Edmund: How did this happen ? @!Simone: I lost it . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's this ? @!Simone: It 's my resignation . I know better than to try to worm my way out of this . I hear they -- they need writers in Hollywood . You think I 'm still young enough that maybe -- that was symbolic . @!Edmund: What you did stinks , Simone . @!Simone: I know . @!Edmund: But if you can convince yourself that this is the worst mistake you 'll ever make , maybe you can work your way past this . @!Simone: You 'd assign me again ? @!Edmund: I 'd let you submit . @!Simone: How do you feel about this ? @!Brooke: I think you 're a good writer . And if Edmund thinks that we can trust you again , I believe him . @!Simone: Why are you guys doing this for me ? @!Edmund: Oh , I do n't know . But show me -- @!Brooke: Mm-hmm . @!Edmund: Any good reporter who has n't screwed up royally at least once . Not in this room , I promise you . @!Simone: I was brought in for questioning by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What about Derek ? Is he pressing charges ? @!Simone: Oh , they 're talking about it . @!Brooke: So did you get a lawyer ? I mean , a good one ? @!Simone: No . I guess I should , huh ? @!Amy: Excuse me , Edmund . @!Edmund: Yeah . Hey , you guys . @!Amy: Ted down in editorial -- he 's screaming for you , and he did n't even need an intercom . @!Man: Yeah , we had a meeting at 10:00 . Everybody 's down there waiting . @!Edmund: Screaming , huh ? Yeah , I 'm coming . Are we cool on this ? @!Simone: Yeah . Thank you , Edmund . @!Edmund: Okay . And -- listen to Brooke . Get a good lawyer . We 'll talk . @!Simone: Okay . Is he for real ? @!Brooke: Yeah , he is . # @!Erica: Do n't make me get ugly with you , Ryan . @!Ryan: Erica , this is none of your business . @!Erica: That man in there is your father . I know this is all news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he did for you last night ? @!Ryan: No , you do n't . I 'll see you . @!Erica: He took a bullet for you , you ungrateful louse ! Look , I can only imagine what you 've been going through since you found out that Chris is your father . @(Kendall-sighs) @!Kendall: Can you , Erica ? Really ? @!Erica: Chris -- Chris deserves to be thanked , if nothing else . Ryan , please do this . It would mean the world to him . # @!Ryan: I -- I just wanted to say thank you for what you did last night . @!Chris: Years -- years of training . @!Erica: Oh , please . You men are impossible . Chris did n't do what he did for you just because he was doing his job . Chris took that bullet for you , Ryan , because he 's your father . @!Ryan: We 're strangers , Erica , so please save me the movie of the week crescendo , all right ? The only thing I have in common with this guy is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are Kendall Hart 's mother . # @!Kendall: Look , Bianca , Erica really did ask for you last night . She was tired and upset and afraid , and I was right there with her , and she looked me in the eye and said she needed you . @!Bianca: Kendall , why are you even telling me this ? @!Kendall: Because for one , brief second , I actually wanted to help her , and she did n't want my help . But if I could help her get you back in her life , then that 's -- @!Bianca: I have to go . @!Kendall: What ? @!Bianca: Just -- if you talk to Chris , please let him know that I 'm glad he 's better , okay ? @!Kendall: Bianca , you ca n't -- oh , God . She really is her mother 's daughter . # @!Ryan: Well , this was obviously a mistake . I 'm glad that you 're -- I 'm glad you 're okay and I 'm glad that I 'm not dead . So I guess we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , no , no . I 'm done . @!Chris: Ryan -- Ryan , wait . Ow ! Oh . @!Erica: What is it , Chris ? @!Chris: Oh , God . @!Erica: What ? @!Chris: No . I ca n't -- I -- @!Erica: What ? @!Chris: I ca n't move -- I ca n't -- I ca n't move my legs . @!Joe: How are you doing , Chris ? @!Erica: Oh , Joe , Joe -- Chris ca n't move his legs . @!Joe: Well , let me see what 's going on . @!Nurse: Dr . Martin needs to examine the patient in private . @!Erica: Joe ? @!Joe: Erica , I will see you after I examine Chris . Please . Yeah . @!Joe: Chris , after the surgery , we took a pretty close look around . There 's a bullet fragment lodged right next to your spine . @!Chris: And -- and you left it there ? @!Joe: We had to . Your life was at stake . Believe me , repairing your heart was one hell of a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to do . Once you 're stabilized , got your strength back , if there 's no increase in mobility , we 'll go back in there and remove the fragment and we 'll take it from there . @!Chris: Yeah . I do n't -- I do n't hear any guarantees , Doc . Do I ? Do I ? # @!David: This is a joke . Come on . I mean , there 's no way that my mother 's some drug kingpin -- @!Anna: Well , think about it . @!David: I am . I 'm the only one thinking here . @!Anna: She has the means . She has the knowledge . She has an unbelievably foolproof cover . @!David: Oh . @!Anna: Being a social-climbing poser keeps you exempt from suspicion . @!David: This is so stupid . Come on , Anna . My mother 's not smart enough to pull this off . I know it , believe me ! @!Anna: I think she is . I think she 's brilliant . However , she 's also vulnerable , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe this . @!Anna: Well , she was here . What the hell was she doing here ? You know ? And you said yourself that you heard someone else in here , like maybe she was hiding -- @!David: Yes , yes . She was hiding someone . Of course she was . That 's because the woman is the town slut . Everybody knows that -- what ? What ? What are you doing ? @!Anna: Well , I do n't know who this belongs to . @!David: You 're kidding , right ? This is Greenlee 's apartment , is n't it ? @!Anna: Oh , no . That 's not her style . It 's not flashy enough . This is a cheap earring , like something a young person would wear . @!David: Look -- look -- if -- if Vanessa killed Larry , it was a crime of passion , all right ? Like -- like -- like Paolo , like -- @!Anna: Like your father ? David , I 'm sorry . It 's Vanessa . You have to see it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmm . Charles was more than just useless . He would have ruined David 's life had he lived . @!Maggie: So this no-killing rule is n't really set in stone , is it ? @(Vanessa-chuckles) @!Vanessa: Charles was my husband , not my family . @!Maggie: You did n't love him ? @!Vanessa: I wanted a child , and Charles served that purpose perfectly well , and he gave me one . @!Maggie: You said before that he -- that he ruined David . What did you mean by that ? @!Vanessa: Well , Charles knew very well that he could n't compete with my love for David , so he took on being the most successful , wealthiest businessman in the world , and he almost pulled the whole thing off , too . @!Maggie: What did he do ? @!Vanessa: Well , my dear , you ca n't make that kind of money totally legally . So we both understood that . But Charles suddenly decided to develop a conscience . He said that he could n't look David in the eye because of the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak ? @!Vanessa: Because Charles ' inability to keep his promises in all the plans that I had for David , and then the -- and then the call came . @!Maggie: What call ? @!Vanessa: Someone called and threatened my son because of the promises that Charles could not keep on the job . So I confronted him . Sniveling idiot sold out our family because he was scared ! So I had to take it over . I had to take it over . I had to keep it all clean . I had to keep it all clean and to keep David safe . So -- @(Vanessa-chuckles) @!Vanessa: Well , that 's the day I made a deal with the devil . @!Maggie: So that 's -- that 's when you started this whole -- whole thing , whatever it is . @!Vanessa: You know , I never looked back . @!Maggie: How did you do it ? @!Vanessa: I bargained . I bargained for my son 's life . So I took over what Charles was too weak to handle . And he -- well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that I had taken over and did a better job of what he abandoned . Oh . @!Maggie: So he killed himself ? @!Vanessa: It was the best thing that ever happened to me . # @!David: I ca n't process any of this right now . @(Doorbell-rings) @!Anna: Wait . Oh , hi . @!Bianca: Hi . @!Anna: Hi , Bianca . @!Bianca: I 'm looking for Leo . @!David: Yeah , so am I . @!Bianca: Is something wrong ? @!Anna: Ah -- we 're just trying to find that out , actually . Oh -- @!Bianca: Oh -- @!Anna: Oh , I 'm sorry . @!Bianca: Where did you get this ? @!Anna: We found it here . Why ? @!Bianca: It 's -- it 's Maggie's . @!David: Maggie 's ? @!Anna: Are you sure about that ? @!Bianca: Yeah , I notice her jewelry a lot . I notice a lot about her . She just -- looks just like Frankie . She was wearing it the last time I saw her . Why ? What is it doing here ? # @(Vanessa-chuckles) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of deep psychological battle here , do n't you ? But , in fact , that 's not what 's happening at all . See , I 'm telling you about my past in order to comfort you . @!Maggie: Comfort me ? @!Vanessa: Hmm . @!Maggie: Well , you 're a force to be reckoned with . @!Vanessa: Hmm . @!Maggie: Not at all like my mother . @!Vanessa: Hmm . Well , you should know that sisters are -- well , can be very different . I mean , Mary Frances -- she was very vulnerable , but she was brave . @!Maggie: You do n't think I 'm brave ? @!Vanessa: Well , I think you think you are . @!Maggie: Oh , do n't underestimate me . Oh , no , because you do n't know what I can do and who I am . @!Vanessa: Oh , oh , oh . Well , who knew ? @!Maggie: Who knew what ? @!Vanessa: That you would remind me so much of myself . Hmm , hmm , hmm . Now , dear , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you ? Hmm ? Next move is your choice . Hmm . You know , there are great advantages , distinct advantages , making a deal with the devil . I mean , look at me . I have all the power in the world . @!Maggie: Do you ? @!Vanessa: Well , I have all the power I need over you . And , so , what will it be , Mary Margaret ? Are you going to take it ? # @!Erica: Ryan , you should n't feel guilty . @!Ryan: What ? This guy has been trouble since the day he showed up here , and now he goes off and he does this -- this -- this stupid thing . He gets shot and I have to owe him forever ? @!Erica: How can you say such a thing ? How can you talk like that ? He 's your father . @!Ryan: Even if he is , he 's no better than the one that 's dead and buried . @!Erica: What an awful thing to say ! Chris is your real father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Kendall: You are the pot calling the kettle black this morning , are n't you ? @!Erica: What ? @!Kendall: Back off him , okay ?

Chris needs you . @!Kendall: Man , you are such a piece of work . # @!Simone: Oh , I so knew better than this . @!Brooke: Like falling in love with a married man ?

He 's got a wife , a kid . He loves them . And I still let myself crash . @!Brooke: You did n't let yourself , Simone . Love does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself from loving Edmund ? @!Brooke: How did you know about Edmund ? @!Simone: Well , the ring on your finger kind of confirms what this whole place has been talking about long before I got here . @!Brooke: People knew ?

So -- @!Simone: Can I ask you how long you and Edmund have known ? @!Brooke: What , that we were in love with each other ? @!Simone: Yeah . @!Brooke: A long time . It 's just that the time was n't right until now . @!Simone: Helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timing . @!Simone: Yeah .

What do you have ? @!Trey: Well , unlike Liza , numbers do n't lie . This should be more than enough for you to divorce your embezzling wife and boot her out of Chandler Enterprises . My advice is to go for the kill now . @!Adam: I 'll decide what to do with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divorce can be a drawn-out procedure . Unless you 've got something else in store for Liza . # @!Liza: Mother , would you do me a favor ? @!Marian: I 'll do anything for you , my darling . @!Liza: I could n't eat before my tests . Would you go across the street and get me something -- a smoothie , blueberry ? @!Marian: One blueberry smoothie coming up . @!Liza: Thanks . @!Marian: Stuart , why do n't you show Liza the picture that Colby painted for her Mommy ? I 'll be back in a flash , my darling . @!Liza: Okay . @!Marian: Love you . @!Liza: Bye . @!Stuart: This -- yeah , this is -- it 's Colby -- Colby and I have been working on perspective , and this , you can see , Adam 's head is about as big as the house . @!Liza: Yeah . @!Stuart: And look at you . You 're so little . And , of course , there 's Aunt Mia . Liza ? Are you okay ? You do n't seem yourself today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot lately . @!Stuart: Did Colby 's drawing upset you ? # @!Opal: Well , Joe , just give it to me straight , will you ? I mean , what 's wrong ? @!Joe: Opal , I did n't mean to alarm you . Palmer 's condition has stabilized . @!Erica: Well , that 's good news . @!Opal: Yeah , but what is the matter with him ? @!Joe: Exhaustion and dehydration have aggravated his heart condition . And frankly , if he does n't start taking care of himself , the next time , he may not be so lucky . @!Opal: Well , I 'm going to see to it that there is no next time . I mean , that stubborn old coot , he thinks he knows everything . He never follows his doctor 's orders . He 'll think twice when I am done with him . @!Joe: Opal -- Palmer asked me to give you a message . Go home . # @!Singer: Can you still remember how it seemed that we could live forever in a lovers ' dream ? @!Ryan-'s-voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make sure that it stays off for good . You know what I 'm saying ? @!Kendall-'s-voice Why ? You own this roach motel ? @!Ryan: No , I do n't own it . I 'm staying across from you , okay ? @!Kendall: Really ? Well , hi , neighbor . Want to party ? @!Ryan: No , I do n't . I told you what I want . I want quiet . @(Knock-on-door) @!Singer: A silly little love song for myself @!Kendall: Who are you ? @!Man: The name 's Stan . I hear you 're in arrears . @!Kendall: What ? @!Stan: Behind on your motel bill . @!Kendall: Oh , I worked out a deal with Artie , the manager . @!Stan: Well , I 'm the owner . So whatever deal you worked out with Artie is smoke . Which does n't mean that you and I ca n't do business . Do you want to pay , or do you want to play ? @!Stan: So , babe , you be good to me , and I 'll be good to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Kendall: I 'll get you your money . @!Stan: Let me check out your assets . @!Chris: What part of " no " do n't you get ? @!Stan: Hey , man , we 're doing business here . @!Chris: Good . 50 ought to cover a couple of nights in this dump . Now , beat it . @!Stan: You still owe me . I 'll be back to collect . @!Kendall: What a scuz . Thanks , Chris . @!Chris: You can save your gratitude . I just did you a favor , and now you can pay me back . @!Kendall: How ? @!Chris: You leave this town and do n't come back -- ever . @!Kendall: I do n't get you , Stamp . You just paid for me to stay . @!Chris: I just paid the sleaze off so you did n't have to play mattress tag for your rent . @!Kendall: You did that for me ? @!Chris: No . No , I did it for Ryan . @!Kendall: I was n't going to let him do anything . @!Chris: Please , please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into your act , and I was about to get sick . @!Kendall: You 're wrong about me . @!Chris: You know , the only good thing about Ryan being gone right now is he does n't have to be here to see you crawl . @!Kendall: Forget you ! @!Chris: Start packing . @!Kendall: Hello . Genius , I 'm broke . No one 's going to give me a free ride . What 's this ? @!Chris: That 's a one-way plane ticket back home to Florida , Kendall , and some cash to tide you over until you get some honest work . Now you have no excuse to stay here . All you have to do is get on the plane and never come back . # @!Opal: Well , I do n't know why I would ever expect that old polecat -- @!Erica: Opal , I am sure that Palmer did n't mean -- @!Opal: No , no , listen , I got the message loud and clear . That old goat wants me to scram ? Well , consider me scrammed . @!Erica: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmer sees you -- @!Joe: No , I 'm really sorry , but Palmer was quite definite about not wanting visitors , especially Opal . @!Erica: Well , he 'll see me , Joe . You wait right here , Opal , because I 'm going to give that old polecat a lesson in gratitude . @!Erica: Palmer , I hope that I 'm not disturbing you . @!Palmer: Well , yes , you are , and I told Joe -- @!Erica: You can tell Joe , you can bark orders at Joe Martin , but Erica Kane takes orders from nobody , including you . @!Palmer: Erica , come here . # @!Liza: I 'm sorry , Stuart . @!Stuart: Here . @!Liza: It 's just that I think that the brain tumor might be back , and if that 's true , then I could be a danger to my daughter . @!Stuart: You could hurt Colby ? No , you could never do that . You love her too much . @!Liza: I love Adam , too , but somehow I took a machete to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just dumb luck he was n't in it at the time . @!Stuart: Why would you do something like that ? @!Liza: I have no idea . I do n't even remember doing it . @!Stuart: Well , maybe you did n't do it . A lot of people would like to slice Adam up . He 's got a lot of enemies . @!Liza: Who raid corporations , not his wardrobe . I think it had to be me . And the way that I 've been acting lately -- @!Stuart: Can I sit down ? @!Liza: Yeah , yeah . @!Stuart: Everybody has a bad day now and then . @!Liza: This is n't just a bad day , Stuart . It 's been going on for weeks . @!Stuart: But to get this upset over a torn shirt -- @!Liza: It 's not just a shirt . It 's a lot of things . I mean , things disappearing , me seeing things and hearing things . I think I hear something , and then I find out later on it 's completely different . @!Stuart: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marian . Yesterday , she asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee , and I thought she was asking me , " Why are you so doppy ? " @!Liza: Do you ever get so angry and you accuse Marian of cheating on you ? @!Stuart: No . @!Liza: You know , I ca n't help but think about that day in the park when I lost Colby and I did n't even remember being with her at the time . @!Stuart: Liza , you were sick then . @!Liza: What if I 'm sick again ? What if it 's worse this time ? What if I 'm a danger to people that I love ? @!Stuart: No , I do n't think that could possibly be true . But no matter what , you do n't have to worry about Colby . @!Liza: I do n't ? Why not ? @!Stuart: Because Adam and Mia love her so much . Even if you did get sick , they 'd take care of her . They 'd keep her safe . # @!Adam: I pay you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is none of your damn business . @!Trey: You 're the boss . @!Adam: Do n't you forget it . @!Colby: Daddy , Daddy ! @!Adam: Ah , Sweetheart . @!Mia: Sorry , Adam . I thought you and Trey were finished . @!Adam: No , just finishing up a few minor details . Well , what 's going on , pumpkin ? @!Colby: Is Mommy still in the hospital ? @!Adam: Oh , yes , she is , but she 'll be home soon . @!Colby: Good , because I miss her . @!Adam: Yeah , I miss her , too . But your Aunt Mia 's here . She can do anything Mommy can . @!Winifred: Excuse me . It is time for Miss Colby 's bath . @!Adam: Okay , you run along with Winifred . Mia and I will be up later . We 'll tuck you in and kiss you good night . @!Colby: I love you , Daddy . @!Adam: I love you , too , Sweetheart . @!Mia: Well , it 's such a nice night out . I think I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should be upstairs changing . @!Mia: Why ? @!Adam: The fundraiser . Arts in Education . Liza 's on the board . You 're taking her place , remember ? @!Mia: Oh , Adam -- look , I changed my mind . I ca n't do it . @!Adam: Why not ? @!Mia: There 's no way I can take Liza 's place . @!Adam: Oh , that 's where you 're wrong . # @!Stuart: Liza , I 'm going to tell you something that will help you stop worrying . I 'm going to talk to Adam , and I 'm going to tell him that you 're afraid for Colby . @!Liza: No , no , do n't , Stuart . Do n't do that . Do n't do that . He 's worried about me , and I do n't want to pile my fears on top of him . @!Stuart: Adam 's very strong . @!Liza: I know , but I can be strong . Do n't say anything to him . Do n't say anything to my mother . @!Stuart: You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how you hate that . @!Stuart: Yeah , well , so does Marian , and so does Adam . @!Liza: Well , maybe just for a little while ? Please ? @!Stuart: So you can talk to him about it first ? @!Liza: Yes . Yes , and I will . So , where do you think my mother is ? @!Stuart: Oh , the smoothie ? @!Liza: Yeah , probably . @!Stuart: I 'll go find her . I 'll go look for her . @!Dr-.-Greenberg Oh -- Mr . Chandler . @!Stuart: Hi . Bye . @!Dr-.-Greenberg Uncanny . How are you , Liza ? @!Liza: Anxious . You have my test results ? @!Dr-.-Greenberg Best possible news -- your tumor has not returned . @!Liza: Yet . @!Dr-.-Greenberg And there 's no indication that it ever will . @!Liza: Well , if it did , what kind of symptoms would I be experiencing ? @!Dr-.-Greenberg Your husband has grilled my partner pretty extensively on that subject . Symptoms for the return of a tumor might include -- @!Liza: Excuse me , I 'm sorry . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @!Dr-.-Greenberg Several weeks ago . I was out of town on a sabbatical at a symposium , and Dr . Dacarlo filled in for me . @!Liza: So Adam came to him and asked him information on my condition ? @!Dr-.-Greenberg Yes . Apparently , he was very upset . He did n't share that with you ? @!Liza: No . But he probably did n't want to worry me about it , so since it 's my condition , maybe you can just get me up to speed . @!Dr-.-Greenberg Yes . Warning signals for the return of a tumor might include such things as memory lapses , disorientation , auditory and visual hallucinations . @!Liza: Hallucinations ? @!Dr-.-Greenberg Seeing things that are n't there . @!Liza: Like lights flashing or something like that ? @!Dr-.-Greenberg Exactly . @!Liza: And hearing things incorrectly . @!Dr-.-Greenberg Yes . It 's a misfiring of the way the brain perceives information . @!Liza: It 's interesting . @!Dr-.-Greenberg But as I said , your CT scan is perfectly clear , so any fears you have would be ungrounded . @!Liza: Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope your husband does n't mind that I informed on him . @!Liza: No . No , I wo n't say anything . Oh , but do n't leave . When do I get to go home ? @!Dr-.-Greenberg Right now . I 'll have the duty nurse call Mr . Chandler and have him come pick you up . @!Liza: No , no , do n't do that . This is really good news , and I want to surprise Adam myself . # @!Adam: Were n't you about to get me that Ingalls file out of your car ? @!Trey: Right away . @!Adam: Yeah . Now , about that fundraiser -- @!Mia: I know you think I 'm a very silly person , but the charity circuit -- it 's just not my thing . @!Adam: Why not ? @!Mia: Schmoozing with C.E.O.s , trying to hit them up for donations -- that 's your life , Adam . That 's where you and Liza shine . @!Adam: Well , Liza and I are hardly society brats . I was raised in pigeon hollow , for crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was possum stew and lantern slides . @!Mia: Well , you 've certainly come a long way from Pigeon Hollow . @!Adam: Well , I picked up what I needed along the way , and so will you . @!Mia: I do n't really think so . I 'm more of a behind-the-scenes kind of person . @!Adam: That would be a waste of a beautiful face . @!Mia: I 'm not anywhere near as gracious or poised as Liza is . @!Adam: Oh , come on , forget Liza . I mean , you just have to be yourself and you will charm the socks off those stuffed shirts the way you 've charmed all of us . @!Mia: Look ; even if I think I can pull this evening off , I do n't have anything to wear . @!Adam: Behold your fairy godfather . @!Mia: Excuse me ? @!Adam: I 've gotten one of Liza 's designers to whip you up an appropriate confection , complete with shoes , bag , and earrings . Winifred 's putting it all in your room . @!Mia: You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's just -- @!Adam: Oh , but it 's -- it 's for a very worthy cause , and it 's an obligation , believe me . Liza will be very grateful that you 're handling it for her . Takes a lot of stress off of her . @!Mia: Well , if you put it that way , I guess it would be kind of selfish if I refused . @!Adam: Then you 'll go ? @!Mia: I 'd be honored . Thanks for talking me into it . @!Adam: Good . Maybe you should go up and change . @!Mia: Oh , yeah . Yeah . @!Adam: What are you smiling about ? @!Trey: Because I finally get it . You 're not just dumping your wife . You 're trading in the old model for a new one . # @!Palmer: Why all this fuss over a few heart palpitations ? My heart 's going to be just fine in the morning . It really is . @!Erica: Palmer , I wish that were true , but it takes time for a heart to mend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaguest notion what you 're talking about . @!Erica: Palmer this is me you 're speaking to . You ca n't fool me . I know what 's got you down , Palmer . Losing Dixie was a blow to just about everyone , but to you , I know it was like losing a daughter . @!Palmer: Oh , God . Erica , I miss her so much . Damn it . I just -- I do n't know how I 'm going to go on without her . @!Erica: Oh , Palmer . # @!Kendall: You can save your trip to nowhere and your money . I 'm not leaving . @!Chris: Why ? What 's the problem ? @!Kendall: I 'm looking at it . @!Chris: You do n't get it , do you , Kendall ? Nobody wants you around here . You 're the town pest . @!Kendall: Do I look like I care ? @!Chris: Yeah . Yeah , it does . That 's why I 'm going to leave this here with you , let you sleep on it . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up on my offer and get the hell out of town . You got some hell of a nerve holding on to something that 's not yours . @!Kendall: No . Ryan gave it to me . @!Chris: Yeah , he gave it to you . He gave it to you when he thought you were someone worth sharing his life with , someone who would n't stab him through the heart the first chance that she got . @!Kendall: What , you mean like your slutty pie Gail did ? @!Chris: Shut up . @!Kendall: Notice I did n't ditch Ryan to go back to some drug-dealing wife beater -- @!Chris: You shut that trap of yours ! @!Kendall: No , no ! No way in hell ! @!Kendall: No , you ca n't have this . It 's all I have left of -- @!Chris: Keep it . Whatever meaning it had , it 's gone . What ? Are you here to help her ? @!Aidan: No , I think Kendall can handle her own affairs . @!Kendall: Well , you both can just go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Chris: Let me offer you some free advice -- you give Kendall a wide berth , a very wide berth . @!Aidan: That wo n't be a problem . @!Chris: Glad to hear it . I 'll see you on the construction site . @!Aidan: Thanks , Chris . @!Kendall: Aidan , wait . I -- I need you to do something for me . # @!Palmer: You know , you 're right . Dixie -- she was like a daughter to me . @!Erica: And she loved you the same way , Palmer . @!Palmer: She had her whole life ahead of her , her whole life . And , of course , that new life inside of her . @!Erica: Your grandniece -- @!Palmer: Yeah . @!Erica: Little baby Kate . @!Palmer: I was looking forward to her arrival . You know , I imagined her a little miniature -- Dixie is fearless , full of joy . You know , I wanted to guide her through life and protect her from all its bumps and , you know , disappointments . Well -- I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petey , needs you so much , and so does Dixie 's son , J.R . They need you to be there for them . @!Palmer: No , Erica , you know I love those boys very much . I really do . But boys are different . They strike out for independence so soon . @!Erica: Well , I know someone else that you can be there for , someone who still cares very deeply about you , palmar . And if you would swallow that silly pride of yours , you would admit that you still have feelings for her , too . @!Palmer: No . No . Opal and I are finished . She is out of my life , and I ca n't let her back in -- ever . # @!Adam: Trey , need I remind you that anything you hear or see in this house remains in this house ? @!Trey: Strict client-attorney confidentiality . @!Adam: And any of my private business that you make public , I will tell the world where Trey Kenyon III 's body is buried . @!Trey: Message received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @(Phone-rings) @!Adam: Adam Chandler . @!Woman: Mr .

She 's being released tonight . @!Adam: Your bank balance will reflect my gratitude . So Liza 's coming home . Well , I should dress appropriately for the occasion . Winifred ! Lay out my tuxedo ! # @!Jake: Liza , I just got the good news from Greenberg . What a relief . @!Liza: Yeah , I 'm lucky . @!Jake: Yeah . Well , listen , nothing personal , but I do n't want to see your face around here again . @!Liza: Well , it 's a deal . @!Jake: Hmm . Oh , I was going to ask you to give this to Mia . @!Liza: What is it ? @!Jake: There you go . It 's an article from her old neighborhood in Brooklyn . Thought she 'd get a kick out of it . @!Liza: Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift home , you can give it to her yourself . Maybe you can even grab a bite to eat . @!Jake: Yeah , yeah , there you go . The night 's starting to look up . @!Liza: Actually , you know , I have a question for you . Are you serious about Mia ? @!Jake: Well , you know , I 'm not really sure . Stuff keeps getting in the way . @!Liza: What stuff ? @!Jake: Well , for starters , your husband . # @!Aidan: I told you before , Kendall , I do n't want to be a part of these games that you play . @!Kendall: Well , I did n't take you for the play-it-safe type . @!Aidan: You did n't take me at all . @!Kendall: Whatever . Do me a favor and give this to your boss . Tell him I do n't need handouts . @!Aidan: You sure about this ? I mean , I heard Artie asking you for the rent yesterday . You know what ? A change of scenery might be just the ticket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , not that anyone asked you . @!Aidan: And the rent ? @!Kendall: I 'll come up with it somehow . I do n't need charity from Chris Stamp . @!Aidan: Chris I get . But what about my money ? Is that dirty , too ? # @!Erica: Palmer , do you know that Opal saved your life tonight ? @!Palmer: One more reason I ca n't face her . @!Erica: I 'm sorry , I do n't understand . @!Palmer: Well , every time I fall , Opal 's there . @!Erica: To help you up . @!Palmer: No , to say , " I told you so . " Her and her blasted intuitions . Whenever she gets a feeling , damned if it is n't always right . @!Erica: And this is a bad thing ? @!Palmer: Well , it 's just bloody embarrassing . You know , she was right about Vanessa . @!Erica: She was right about your not taking care of yourself . @!Palmer: She 'll just march in here with that smug look . She 'll wag her bony finger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the look on her face is anything but smug . She 's worried about you , so much so that she has someone looking after you at the Valley Inn . Did you know that ? Since you wo n't look after yourself . @!Palmer: Well , I do n't need a nursemaid . I do n't . @!Erica: No , what you need is your family , and that includes Opal , divorced or not . Opal understands better than anyone exactly how deeply Dixie 's death has affect you , how lost and alone you feel . @!Palmer: Oh , all right , I guess it would n't hurt to spend a few minutes with the old witch . I mean , if it 's going to make her feel better . But if she starts in on me , let me tell you , to the moon -- @!Erica: Well , I will tell her to come in . @!Erica: Opal -- @!Opal: Well , so , how is the old grinch holding up ? @!Erica: He is waiting for you to come in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till they make snowmen in hell because I am not going in there . # @!Jake: Liza , Mia is your sister and she wants to help you in any way that she possibly can . It just bothers me to see her give up her own personal life and put it on hold , you know , especially now that you 're doing so well . @!Liza: Well , Mia 's amazing . @!Jake: Yeah , she is . I just think it was a real mistake for her to leave , especially since this job was doing so much to help her self-esteem . @!Liza: You know , now that you 've shared that with me , I agree with you , and I think I should have a talk with Mia and encourage her to take her job back . @!Jake: That would be great . @!Liza: You know , Dr . Greenberg says I 'm fine . I mean , I 'm really fine . There is no reason why she should be at the house with me and Adam . @!Jake: Good , good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think Adam 's the one that 's going to take some convincing . @!Liza: Well , I 'll tell you what -- you leave Adam to me . @!Jake: Gladly . Shall we ? @!Liza: Yes . # @!Winifred: Miss Mia ! You look like a princess from one of Colby 's fairy tales . @!Mia: Thank you , Winifred . @!Winifred: Oh , I just wish Mrs . Chandler were here to see you . @!Mia: Uh -- yeah . Where 's Mr . Chandler ? @!Adam: He 's right behind you . You look stunning . It would be a privilege to have you on my arm this evening . Shall we ? @!Mia: No way . I 'm not going anywhere with you . # @!Erica: Opal , excuse me . I do not understand you . Just a few minutes ago , you would have given anything to go in there and see Palmer and see that he was all right . @!Opal: Well , that was before he sent out the " Do not disturb " signal . @!Erica: Oh , Opal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my head , you know ? @!Erica: Opal , believe me , it is not personal . @!Opal: Oh , yeah . @!Erica: He is feeling very fragile right now . He is because of Dixie and because of a lot of things . His pride is at war with his need to connect with people who really care about him . @!Opal: Well , there 's only so much caring you can do until you just have to give it up as a lost cause . @!Erica: Well , you know something ? I 'm already late to meet Chris , so do n't you give up on anything , okay ? Get in there . # @!Winifred: Excuse me , please . @!Mia: I thought I was doing this alone . @!Adam: You 're not willing to go to a fundraiser with me ? I -- well , why not ? Am I such terrible company ? @!Mia: Adam , Liza already thinks that we have something going on . She outright accused us of -- @!Adam: And we know there 's nothing going on . @!Mia: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends will be there , and word will get back to Liza that we 're -- @!Adam: That we what ? That we raised some money for a worthy cause ? @!Mia: I am not going to cause any more trouble for you or your wife , who is my sister . @!Adam: Coward . @!Mia: What ? @!Adam: This has nothing to do with Liza . You 're afraid . You 're afraid to face that crowd . You 're afraid that you wo n't measure up . @!Mia: Adam -- @!Adam: Well , let me put your doubts to rest . You 'll outshine every woman in that room tonight . And if I may be so bold as to add a small finishing touch . @!Mia: It 's beautiful . @!Adam: Allow me to put it on you ? @!Mia: Is it real ? @!Adam: Of course it 's real . I gave it to Liza for Christmas . @!Mia: No , no , Adam , I ca n't .

When did she ever do the right thing ? @!Chris: Well , Darling , there 's always a first time . @!Erica: Chris , I want you to know I have been completely honest with her .

This is an inspired idea . @!Greenlee: That 's right , and I do n't need cheerleading , I need results . The next chapter in my life has to start right now . @!Trey: Yeah , that 's right . This is the time . @!Greenlee: Do you know how long I 've been dreaming and planning my own cosmetics company ? @!Trey: Cosmetics empire . @!Greenlee: Yes ! So to find this factory on sale just when I 'm ready -- I mean , how could I ignore it ? A pharmaceutical plant empty and practically waiting for me ? And the beauty part is it 's right here in Pine Valley . @!Trey: Right under Enchantment 's nose . @!Greenlee: Oh ! Erica is going to look out her penthouse window and cringe . @!Trey: That 's as good a motivation as any . I 'll have the same thing , please . Greenlee , I just wanted to thank you for making me a part of this . @!Greenlee: Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an idea . You know , why are you sitting here fantasizing with me when you should be out there cutting a deal on that building ? @!Trey: That 's happening right now . See , I 've got a secret weapon . @!Greenlee: What ? @!Trey: A person whose motivation is not very different from yours . Nothing can stop her when she wants something . @!Greenlee: " She " ? # @!Petey: And I do n't mean the newsstand across the street . I 'm talking about the one here in the lobby . @!Kendall: We 're not going anywhere until your dad comes . @!Petey: Yeah , but -- @!Kendall: Besides , I do n't have five bucks for one of those violent comic books . @!Petey: It 's not a comic book . It 's a graphic novel . You know , art . @!Kendall: You want art ? How about I take one of those ketchup and mustard dispensers from over there and do some face painting ? @!Petey: You 're in a bad mood because you want to hit my dad up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snoop and that your ears and your mouth were a lot smaller . @!Petey: You know , I could tell my dad I 'm buried in homework and get him out of here before you can start sweet-talking him . @!Kendall: All right , all right . What do you want now ? @!Petey: Three movie rentals and a pizza . @!Kendall: Fine . You got a deal . @!Petey: We 're on the same side , Kendall . It 's good for me if my old man starts thinking generous -- dad ! @!Palmer: Hey , I hope I have n't kept you waiting . You ready to go , Sport ? @!Petey: Do we have to ? @!Palmer: What ? @!Petey: How about I treat you and Nanny Kendall to some coffee ? @!Palmer: Well , that 's very nice of you , son . Yeah . Kendall ? @!Kendall: I 'd love it . Thank you . @!Petey: I 'll order . And if you do n't mind , I 'll stay at the bar and have a Roy Roger . @!Palmer: Good . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Palmer: There 's not a sweet molecule in that body . But he knows how to get what he wants , just like his old man . @!Kendall: That 's very important to you , is n't it ? @!Palmer: Yes , it is . Do n't have much use for people who do n't . @!Kendall: Well , I always listen to what you say . I try to make it work for me . @!Palmer: What 's on your mind ? @!Kendall: For example , I remember you telling me that I should n't care about anyone else 's opinions , that I have to believe in myself and make my dreams come true . @!Palmer: You have me confused with a greeting card . @!Kendall: Well , that 's not exactly what you said , but I remember you telling me , Palmer , that the only thing that matters is what I think . @!Palmer: Yes , I did say that , and , yes , I believe that . @!Kendall: You like me , Palmer . Admit it . @!Palmer: Yes , I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knack for ticking people off . @!Kendall: That 's true . But I hope I wo n't tick you off because I need to ask you a favor -- a big one . @!Palmer: And you expect that I 'll say yes because I like you ? @!Kendall: I hope so , yes . # @!Mia: You -- you pushed me out of the window ? @!Liza: It was an accident . I -- I tripped on my dress . @!Mia: But all this time -- why did n't you just say that ? @!Liza: I thought -- I was so wrong , Mia . @!Jake: No , you thought that Mia was sleeping with Adam . You thought that all along . @!Tad: She made a mistake , guys . Please hear her -- @!Liza: Mia , I made a terrible , terrible mistake . Mia , I am so sorry . @!Jake: Oh , you 're sorry ? My God , Liza , you tried to kill your own sister . @!Tad: Jake , give her a chance . Just listen to her . @!Jake: No , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any harm . @!Jake: Oh , she says that now . @!Liza: No , it 's true . @!Jake: Liza , this anger started months ago when you came to me and told me that you thought Mia was sleeping with Adam because a cufflink was found in Mia 's bed . @!Liza: Jake , you know . You remember then . I was very sick . @!Jake: You never even believed in Mia . @!Liza: I did ! It 's just there were so many things to confuse me . Every time I turned around , you were whispering and talking with each other . You were the one who encouraged me to get a divorce . @!Mia: Because you were miserable . That had nothing to do with me . @!Liza: You went to New York in secret together . And every time I was n't watching and I would come into the room , you would be hugging and you would have your head on his shoulder . @!Mia: But do you really think that I could do something like that to you ? I would sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you like that ? Did you ever , ever trust me ? @!Liza: I did . When I was dying , you were the one that I reached out to to take care of my daughter . @!Mia: And I asked you to do the same thing for my son . @!Liza: And I promised I would , that William would lack for nothing . @!Mia: I do n't want your promises , Liza . I want answers . # @!Greenlee: Trey , I wanted this deal kept quiet . Who is this secret " she " weapon ? @!Trey: Just forget I said anything . @!Greenlee: You know , I could 've hired some hotshot real estate chick , too . I know the type -- business suit with the little skirt , manly handshake , and a smile right out of her assertiveness seminar . @!Trey: I did n't hire a real estate broker . It 's just the opposite . I got this person involved because she 's very close with the man who owns the building . @!Greenlee: Oh . And who is that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a corporate shark . He 's going to know how valuable the property is . And he 's one of Erica 's best friends . @!Trey: Which is the exact same reason why I think we should get the inside track . She 's part of the family , in a way . @!Greenlee: In what way ? @!Trey: Would you stop ? I 'm on it . I 've already said too much . It 's going to happen . Do n't worry . @!Greenlee: Because you say so ? Trey , my entire future is in the hands of someone that I do n't know . @!Trey: You know her . @!Greenlee: " Part of the family " ? Whose family ? Yours ? @!Trey: No . Well -- @!Greenlee: You mean your psycho sister , do n't you ? She 's playing nursemaid to Palmer Cortlandt 's incredibly irritating child ! Why ? Why ? @!Trey: Because Kendall and Mr . Cortlandt get along very , very well . When I happened to mention to her that you were interested in buying this building of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention to her what I want the building for ? @!Trey: Yeah , but do n't worry . Kendall also thinks it 's a great idea to start a cosmetics company in Pine Valley . @!Greenlee: You freakin ' idiot . Of course she does ! @!Trey: Greenlee -- Greenlee , wait . # @!Palmer: And then you were fired ? @!Kendall: Yes , but I was totally valuable at Giovanna Cosmetics . It was their loss . @!Palmer: Oh , I 'm sure it was . @!Kendall: I loved it there , and everybody loved me . I was succeeding , I was doing great -- until I tried to help somebody else . @!Palmer: Hmm . Greenlee Smythe . @!Kendall: Yes . And that backfired . @!Palmer: Well , you wo n't make that mistake again . @!Kendall: No , no , I definitely wo n't . But while I was at Giovanna and when I was at Enchantment before that , I discovered that I have a natural talent for the cosmetics business . @!Palmer: Really ? @!Kendall: Mm-hmm . @!Palmer: Well , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Kendall: My mother is a housewife in Florida , remember ? @!Palmer: Yes . Well , you have it your own way . @!Kendall: Anyway , it was -- it was as if I was discovering myself . I realized I had a great sense of color and a strong nose and -- @!Palmer: " Strong nose " ? @!Kendall: For fragrances . And even more amazingly , I discovered that I have a knack for knowing what the American woman will be thinking about six months from now . @!Palmer: Good Lord . Who told you that ? @!Kendall: Professionals , experts at both companies . Are you laughing at me ? @!Palmer: No , no . No , no , not at all . Your Florida mother notwithstanding , I 'm reminded of the -- all the times through the years that I sat with Erica and listened to her hopes and her dreams with the same kind of fire -- @!Kendall: I 'm not talking about Erica . I 'm talking about me -- my hopes and my dreams . @!Palmer: Yes , of course . @!Kendall: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , Palmer . You 're the only person left who actually believes in me . @!Palmer: What can I do for you ? @!Kendall: You own a building on Front Street . It 's for sale now . A pharmaceutical company was leasing it before they moved out . @!Palmer: Greystone building . What about it ? @!Kendall: I want it for my own business , for my own cosmetics company . @!Palmer: Another cosmetics company in Pine Valley ? @!Kendall: Yes , but it 's not for the reason you think . I 'm not trying to get back at anybody . I 'm not trying to impress anyone . It 's for me . I want to be somebody for me . # @(David-groans) @!Aidan: Hang on , hang on . I 'm getting ahead of myself . There 's a small matter of your alias . @!David: My what ? @!Aidan: Your new name . You 're going to need it in your new life . Maria Grey became Maureen Gorman . You seem to like using the same initials for your human guinea pigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrows it down a little bit . D.H . D.H . Any preferences ? @!David: Be my guest . @!Aidan: Yeah , well , let 's keep it simple , shall we ? Dan Harris . That 's a pretty American name , do n't you think ? " Dan Harris here . Dan Harris , Pest Control . How may I help you ? " Yeah , in your new life , I 'm going to make you an exterminator . You 're going to spend every working day with vermin . It 's quite appropriate , do n't you think ? @!David: No , wait -- no , no , no , no , wait a minute , Aidan ! Aidan , you do n't want to do this . Let me finish my work , all right ? Let me help Maria get her memory back . @!Aidan: You mean trust you , Hayward ? Who do you think you 're dealing with ? @!David: Oh , that 's right , that 's right . You 're the avenging angel of Pine Valley , are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a problem here , Aidan . Maria has a husband . She does n't need you to be her champion ! @!Aidan: You know what ? I do n't think it 's wise to antagonize me at this point in time . @!David: Maria does n't want you to do this , Aidan . @!Aidan: Maria wants justice . That 's what she wants . You took away everything that she knew . Now the same thing is going to happen to you . @!David: Look , then I wo n't be able to help her , ok ? And I want to be able to give back to her what I took from her . @!Aidan: What , you mean with your phony antidote story ? There 's no such thing , David . @!David: And what if there is , huh ? Oh , I see what the problem is . Then if there is and it works , no more Maureen , right ? Maria goes back to her old life , and who the hell are you to her then ? Just some guy she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided -- whoever you become , it can only be an improvement . @!David: Aidan , no , no ! @!Maria: Aidan -- Aidan ! What are you doing ? @!David: You 're just in time . Now get this attack dog off me ! @!Maria: What in God 's name are you doing ? You said you were n't going to do anything crazy . @!Aidan: Yeah , and I have n't . @!Maria: Well , what is this ? @!David: Just untie me and get this maniac out of my house ! @!Maria: Shut up . What is this ? @!Aidan: Look , I had a hunch that he hid the drug that he used on you up here , and I was right . @!Maria: Wait a minute . What are you saying , that this is it ? @!Aidan: Yeah . @!Maria: This is the drug that he used on me ? @!Aidan: The same one . He admitted it . And all I had to do was tie him up and threaten to use it on him . @!David: It does n't change anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So untie me now ! @!Maria: Oh , you really think you 're invincible , do n't you ? You know , the D.A . said that the criminal case against you was weak , but maybe I should just try my luck against you in civil court . @!Aidan: Yeah , and now we have this . It 's proof . @!Maria: Yes , we do . @!David: Proof of what ? All right , big deal , there 's a serum . But the question is , did I inject you with it ? But you 're the only witness , Maureen . You do n't have a memory of it . @!Maria: Yes , but thanks to you , I do n't have a memory of it . @!David: Thanks to me , you 're alive ! Now , let me finish my work . Let me give you back what I took from you ! @!Aidan: You ca n't give back years , Hayward . @!David: I ca n't give her back 10 minutes if I 'm in jail . @!Maria: I would rather not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , David . @!David: Do you really want to waste more of your years fighting me ? @!Aidan: No . She wants to end it right here , right now . Like I said before , Hayward , there are other ways to extract justice . @!David: You wo n't do it . You 're not crazy . @!Aidan: Shall I ? @!Maria: No . Let me . # @!Kendall: Excuse me . @!Palmer: All right , young man . Let 's get you home . What do you say ? @!Petey: Do we have to ? How about another round ? @!Palmer: What ? Three Roy Rogers already ? All that sugar -- good Lord , your mother 's apt to -- she 'll blow a gasket , for heaven 's sakes . @!Petey: Maybe it 'd be good to wait until I calm down a little . I could go to the newsstand and buy a magazine . @!Palmer: Yes . That 's probably a good idea . @!Petey: May I have $5 , please ? Thank you , daddy . @!Greenlee: Palmer . Mr . Cortlandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so afraid I 'd be late , but here you are . @!Palmer: Why -- why were you afraid you 'd be late ? What 's -- what 's the matter ? What 's -- @!Greenlee: Well , I rushed here all the way from B.J . 's , but I need to talk to you . It 's very important . @!Palmer: Obviously it 's important to you . @!Greenlee: The Greystone building on Front Street -- you own it -- @!Palmer: Mm-hmm . @!Greenlee: And I do n't know if you know this or not , but it 's up for sale . I want to buy it . @!Palmer: Oh . Well , I 'm sorry . You 're just a little too late . @!Greenlee: What ? But this morning , it was -- @!Palmer: No , I just -- just gave it away just a few minutes ago . @!Greenlee: You sold it ? @!Palmer: Yeah . @!Greenlee: To whom ? @!Kendall: To me . # @!Liza: Mia , please . You have to know that I would never try to kill you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe . @!Liza: I tripped on the dress , on that stupid dress . @!Tad: Liza was upset with just cause . Adam was cheating on her . @!Mia: And that makes it ok ? @!Liza: No . No . @!Liza: Mia , I love you , and I would never try to hurt you . I followed you up to the attic to talk with you . And when I heard you on the phone , I thought you were talking to Adam and that you were laughing at me . And I was angry at you . @!Mia: Why did n't you just say something to me ? @!Liza: Because I was afraid . I was afraid that if Adam knew what had happened that he would take Colby from me . @!Jake: Oh , Liza , you think that excuses what you 've done ? It does n't even come close . @!Tad: What 's that supposed to mean ? @!Jake: A detective was here with questions . @!Tad: What kind of questions ? @!Jake: He wanted to talk to Mia , to know if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely not . @!Tad: Did he talk to Mia ? @!Jake: No , Tad . She was n't in any kind of shape for that . @!Liza: Jake -- @!Mia: I do n't want to do this anymore . I -- I have to go back to my room right now . @!Jake: I think that 's a good idea . Easy . @!Tad: Jake , what are you going to do ? @!Jake: I 'm going to make sure Mia gets some rest . @!Liza: Mia -- @!Tad: Liza , no , let her go . @!Liza: Oh , my God . How could all of this have gone so wrong ? @!Tad: She 's angry . Ok , they both are . But if you give them enough time , they 'll cool down and they 'll see things the way they are . @!Liza: She thinks I did it on purpose . She thinks that I wanted to hurt her . @!Tad: Then give her some time . Eventually she 'll realize that 's impossible . @!Liza: Do you really think it 's impossible ? @!Tad: Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes perfect sense . The question now is , do you believe it ? @!Liza: You know , they say that there really are no accidents . What if somewhere deep inside me , I wanted to kill her ? # @!David: Maria , you do n't want to do this . This is n't who you are . @!Maria: Really ? You do n't know who I am . I 'm not the person that you created . @!David: No , but I do remember who you were before when I found you on the beach . I remember the last moments as Maria -- @!Maria: Shut up ! I am sick of talking about this , David . @!David: You were fighting for your life . Maria , you were fighting for your life . You were asking for Edmund . You wanted to tell him that Maddie was his child . @!Maria: Enough ! Enough , David . @!David: I told you that I loved you . You remember that ? Injecting you with this drug was the hardest decision of my life , but I chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very funny because that 's where you and I differ . Right now , to me , it just seems so easy . Hold him down , Aidan . @!David: No , no , no -- wait , wait , wait , wait ! Stop it ! Stop it ! # @!Greenlee: Kendall ? You sold that building to your nanny ? Unless she 's more than your nanny . @!Palmer: Are you suggesting an impropriety ? @!Greenlee: Whatever she said to you , she 's broke . I mean , she ca n't possibly afford that building . @!Kendall: Which is why Palmer is leasing it to me for $1 a year . @!Greenlee: No . No way . @!Palmer: Well , as long as she -- as long as she continues in her role , that is , as nanny . @!Kendall: Yeah . That 's what it says . @!Greenlee: A napkin contract ? Palmer , she fooled you . You can get out of it . @!Kendall: Oh , this is just so I can frame it . We also shook on it . @!Greenlee: You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could you possibly want with that factory ? @!Kendall: Well , what do you want with it ? @!Greenlee: You know what I want with it . Your hopeless half brother told you . @!Kendall: Oh , that 's right . You wanted to start a new cosmetics company . You know you stole my idea . @!Greenlee: Liar ! It was my idea . @!Kendall: Well , I 'm the one with the factory . @!Greenlee: You 'll fail , miserably . I mean , you ca n't even afford $1 a year . @!Kendall: Well , it will be a great pleasure to prove you wrong . @!Palmer: Yes , and she will . Well , just read your napkin . You have committed yourself to showing a profit in three years . @!Greenlee: Three years ? Kendall , I ca n't wait three years for you to give up , ok , so just let me -- @!Kendall: I am never giving up . @!Greenlee: What do you know about the cosmetics business ? I mean , you were fired from Enchantment and Giovanna . @!Kendall: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were simply incompetent . @!Kendall: Ah , that 's not true . Ask Boyd Larraby . @!Greenlee: Boyd Larraby ? @!Kendall: The R&amp;D chemist from Enchantment . @!Greenlee: I know who Boyd Larraby is . @!Kendall: Yes , well , I helped him develop Mostly Mocha . @!Greenlee: Mostly Mocha ? @!Kendall: Yes , the lipstick , Enchantment 's biggest seller in six years . @!Greenlee: I know what Mostly Mocha is . Are you telling me you had something to do with it ? @!Kendall: Well , Boyd was having a hard time last Spring . He was going to go with a much darker shade . And I said , no , college girls this fall will want something lighter . So I showed him a new color , he loved it , and he went with it . @!Greenlee: This is absurd . This is a pathetic fantasy . I mean , how many times could you cross paths with Boyd Larraby ? @!Kendall: Enough times for him to completely agree with my decision . Ask him . He 'll confirm it . @!Greenlee: If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- or sleeping with him . @!Trey: All right , guys , this slugfest is not helping anybody . @!Palmer: Oh , no , no , no . I 'm really enjoying it . @!Petey: Me , too . @!Palmer: Ok , son , we 'd better go . @!Petey: But -- @!Greenlee: Palmer -- please . @!Palmer: Yes ? @!Greenlee: Please reconsider . You know I 'm the one with the track record . @!Palmer: Yes , I know . I heard great things about you at Enchantment until , of course , you tried to stab Erica in the back . @!Greenlee: No . No , you do n't understand . @!Palmer: Now , I think it 's time for Kendall to have her stab at success . @!Kendall: Thank you , Palmer . I 'll always come to you for advice . @!Palmer: Would you like a little advice from me now ? I think the two of you should team up , work together . I think good things would come of that . @!Petey: Yeah . @(imitates-explosion) @(Greenlee-snorts) @!Trey: Well , Palmer Cortlandt is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Greenlee: Team up with that backstabbing , conniving , manipulative hustler ? I 'd rather stick my finger in a light socket . @!Kendall: So who 's stopping you ? # @!Jake: Thank you . I need you to hold all her visitors for the next three hours . Thank you . Hey . Hey , listen , I need you to do something for me . I need you to think about us and only us . @!Mia: All I ever wanted was to feel like I belonged . I thought that Liza had accepted me . I thought that she loved me . @!Jake: I love you . And you do belong with me . @!Jake: I want you just to try to get some sleep , ok ? And you let me deal with this , all right ? @!Mia: What are you going to do ? @!Jake: I 'm going to take care of you , now and always . # @!Tad: Liza , you tripped , that 's all . You tripped over that ridiculous skirt and fell into your sister . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would 've happened if I had it out with Mia that night ? That 's why I went up there . What would 've happened then ? @!Tad: It does n't matter . @!Liza: I was angry . If Mia had denied sleeping with Adam , I would n't have believed her . @!Tad: Kiddo , there is no way on earth you will ever convince me that you would intentionally hurt Mia . @!Liza: How did you feel when you found out that Dixie was sleeping with David ? I mean , who would you have hurt ? Not Dixie . David . @!Tad: Where is this going ? @!Liza: You told me that I was the only one who could answer what was going on inside my mind that night . @!Tad: It 's obvious . You were angry with Adam , with your husband who had betrayed you one too many times . You caught him cheating once , and he was doing it all over again . @!Liza: And I said that if I ever caught him that I would -- @!Jake: You would kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mia could 've died . @!Tad: There is no way Liza could possibly feel any worse than she does already . @!Jake: I do n't know about that , Tad . @!Liza: I just need Mia to understand , Jake . That 's the only thing that matters to me right now . @!Jake: But you 're going to stay away from her . @!Liza: Is that what she wants ? @!Jake: It 's what I want , and I 'm going to make sure it happens . Understood ? # @!Trey: Greenlee , sit . Look , I know this is none of my business -- @!Greenlee: You screwed this up big time . @!Kendall: You 're right . Get out , then . @!Greenlee: Have n't you done enough harm ? @!Kendall: Trey , thank you for your help , but I do n't need you anymore . @!Trey: Would you please just sit ? @!Trey: Now , you need someone . What are you going to do with an empty factory ? And what are you going to do without a factory ? @!Kendall: Well , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . @!Greenlee: I 've got capital . Without that , you 've got nothing . @!Trey: So you 're ok money-wise ? Your mother came through with that loan ? @!Greenlee: Well , no , but -- @!Kendall: I thought you were rolling in it . @!Greenlee: In case you have n't heard , the Dow 's bottoming out . @!Kendall: So you do n't even have cash to start the business ? @!Greenlee: I have more cash than you 'll ever see . @!Kendall: Oh , my God , she 's broke ! Well , if it helps , I can get you a cat food recipe book . @!Greenlee: Ho-ho . Well , of course , you 'll never go broke as long as there 's a lamppost that you can stand under . @!Trey: All right , all right , stop . Now I 'm leaving . @!Greenlee-and-Kendall Good . @!Trey: And after I leave , you two can either cut each other to ribbons or you can join forces . @!Greenlee: I do n't need her . @!Kendall: No , she 's no good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planning on using to buy the building . @!Greenlee: Never said I did n't . @!Trey: Look , you two are very close to realizing a very big dream . All you have to do is compromise . @!Kendall: Compromise ? Us ? @!Greenlee: You got to be kidding . I 'm a force to be reckoned with . @!Trey: You 're a force that does n't have a factory . That 's all I 'm going to say . Now , think about it . @!Kendall: So now what ? # @!Maria: Hold him still . @!David: You 're not going to pull this off . You 're going to go to jail , both of you ! @!Aidan: Pretty unlikely , David , because the only witness will be you and you wo n't remember . @!Maria: Hold him still . Hold his arm still . @(David-groans) @!Maria: You deserve this , David . You deserve this . You really deserve this . @!Aidan: Go on . @!Aidan: Do it . @!Maria: I ca n't do it . I ca n't do it . @!Aidan: Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , you ca n't do it , either . If you do this , we 're not going to be able to live with ourselves . If I do what you did to me , I become you . @!David: I knew you could n't go through with it . @!Aidan: We 're going to take this drug , and even if you do n't see a prison cell , you 'll never be a doctor again , Hayward . @!Maria: You know , I may not remember being a doctor , but I do know that you 're not supposed to do any harm . Untie him , Aidan . # @!Greenlee: You knew I wanted that factory . @!Kendall: You knew I did . @!Greenlee: You stole it right out from under me . @!Kendall: Would n't you have done the same thing in my place ? @!Greenlee: Yeah , probably . @!Kendall: So , then , are n't I allowed to come out ahead for once in my life ? @!Greenlee: You 're not ahead . You 're so not ahead . @!Kendall: Right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I also have ambition and energy and a dream that 's just as valid as yours . @!Greenlee: Are you saying that we could really make this work -- our going into business together ? @!Kendall: Well , we do n't trust each other , but we know that going in , which puts us ahead of a lot of other partners . @!Greenlee: But we 'd kill each other . @!Kendall: Are n't we smarter than that ? Nothing else , thank you . The truth is , Greenlee , I need more than just your startup money . @!Greenlee: Is this a snow job ? @!Kendall: You tell me .

Do you like being recognized ? @!Jamie-Lynn It still surprises me sometimes and , of course , people get me , Jamie , confused with the character I play . You know , telling me to be careful and things like that . But it 's all sweet . And they 're always surprised I 'm not taller . @!Hayley: That -- me , too . Is n't that funny ? @!Jamie-Lynn Yeah , they talk about my hair and my clothes and my weight , but you know what it 's like . It 's a point that you work so hard to get to where people recognize you , so you learn to appreciate it . @!Hayley: What about your family ? Was there anybody in your family that was in the business ? @!Jamie-Lynn No . @!Hayley: Or show business or -- @!Jamie-Lynn I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played sports . My dad ran an amateur baseball league and my mom was just at home with us . @!Hayley: So you 're just this nice , normal girl from Long Island that happens to have this incredible talent and -- @!Jamie-Lynn And very lucky .

You 've got this incredible man that gets it . @!Jamie-Lynn It 's really wonderful , especially in this business , to have somebody that 's 100% supportive and appreciative of what you do . @!Hayley: Hmm . @!Jamie-Lynn And A.J . also reminds me that what I do is such a small part of the picture and what really matters is coming together and coming home to each other and our family and our friends . And I 'm sure it 's the same way for you . @!Hayley: Oh , it is . I could kiss the spotlight good-bye tomorrow . You know , as long as I have my husband and my son , that 's all I really care about .

So you should keep that in mind ! @!Aidan: So much for that " do no harm " doctor bullocks , yeah . @!Maria: Look , I thought you wanted to have your freedom so that you could spend time with your wife and child ! Are you crazy ? If you kill him -- @!David: Then I 'll have to kill you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guess what , you 're going to go to prison for the rest of your life ! @!David: Well , what 's the difference ? If I let you walk out that door with that serum , then my life is over , too . @!Maria: No , it 's not , David . @!David: No , it is . It 's the same thing -- my life is over . I go to jail , I never get to practice medicine ever again , right ? Might as well shoot myself . @!Aidan: Hey , that would n't be a bad idea . @!Maria: Aidan -- @!David: Oh , that 's very funny , Aidan . Not a very good time to develop a sense of humor . You should really think about this , Maureen , because if I 'm dead or I end up in jail , I can never help you get your memory back . @!Maria: As if you ever intended to . @!David: Of course I intended to , and I can still do it , but I need access to my research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you take that serum to the police , the chance of your memory coming back goes along with it . All deals are off . You will never remember being Maria Santos Grey ever again , except in tiny bits and pieces from time to time . I do n't have to kill anybody . Do n't make me do this , Maureen . Just hand over the serum . @!David: You know something , Tarzan , why do n't you just face the fireplace . Turn around and face the fireplace ! @!Maria: David -- @!David: Put the vial on the table , now . Just put it on the table ! @!Maria: Look , David , let 's just say that I even accept your offer . You do n't have the funds to be able to -- to fund this whole project . You do n't have any money . @!David: You do n't have to worry about it . @!Maria: You lost -- @!David: You do n't have to worry about that . I have sufficient funding . @!Maria: Where ? Where are you getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok ? @!Maria: Who ? Vanessa ? What , are you getting the money -- are you benefiting from your own mother 's death ? @!David: That 's not your concern . I have a benefactor who believes that I can live up to my claims even if you do n't . @!Maria: And I suppose I 'm just supposed to believe you ? @!David: Yes , you are supposed to believe me because it 's true , and , in time , I can prove it to you . I 've been reviewing the changes that I made in the formula from the time I gave it to you and the pure form that I used on Dixie and Roger Smythe . I know why your memory was affected , and I also know that I can reverse the degeneration of cells . But I need the vial and I need my freedom to do it ! @!Maria: So you 're blackmailing me again ? @!David: Look , just put the damn vial on the table right now or else I put a hole through your watchdog . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up , I thought that you were just desperate . Now I know you 're a head case . @!Maria: What do you mean , " the first time " ? What are you talking about , " first time " ? @!David: Oh , Aidan did n't tell you , huh , that he did this once before to me ? Threatened to break my fingers , my hand , with a sledgehammer ? @!Maria: Aidan ? Aidan ? @!David: Oh , it 's all right . Do n't worry about it . That attack had nothing to do with you . He was all bent out of shape about Auntie Anna . I 'll tell you something -- if you both get out of here alive , I 'd stay clear of this guy . If you fall out of favor with him , who knows ? He 's going to come after you with a -- with a syringe someday . @!Aidan: I do n't think so . I save my anti-social behavior for you , Davy . @!David: You know , maybe I should contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? Might get that psychiatric care that you so desperately needed after Tora Bora . @!Aidan: Why do n't you shut up ? @!David: Why ? What are you going to do , huh ? What , are you going to catch bullets in your teeth and spit them back at me ? Maureen , my arms are getting tired . Put the -- put the damn vial on the table ! Make your choice ! @!Maria: You win , David . @!David: No . You win , Maureen . So does commando-boy . Stand by the door . @!Maria: Let 's get out of here . @!Aidan: Yeah . @!David: That sounds like a good plan . Enjoy the rest of your evening . # @!Liza: It 's my fault , and now everyone knows it . @!Adam: Liza , stop saying that . It 's not true . You are not to blame . @!Liza: I followed Mia up to the attic , and I heard her on the phone , and she was talking about how excited she was about getting pregnant . @!Adam: What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was talking to you . @!Adam: You mean you -- you thought that -- that Mia and I -- @!Liza: I thought she was sleeping with you . @!Adam: How did you come up with that ? @!Liza: Well , you were having an affair . I just had the wrong woman . I now know that you were involved with Brooke . But I did n't know it was Brooke until after Mia fell . @!Adam: Oh , my God . Then my being unfaithful to you was more than you could stand ? @!Liza: I do n't -- I -- I do n't know . I actually did n't think that I would care what you did or who you did it with . But then when all the pieces started coming together and all of them seemed to point to Mia -- and I heard her on the phone , and she was so excited and so in love and -- and then , that night , you know , at the party , Mia was dressed just like my daughter . I was -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I wanted to confront her . I wanted to -- I just wanted her to turn and look at me and admit the truth . And when I went up to the attic and I started to go for her and I tripped on my dress , I put out my hands to stop myself and I -- I ended up pushing her . And the glass breaking -- I looked up , and she was gone . There was just glass everywhere . @!Adam: Liza , it was n't intentional . @!Liza: In my heart -- in my heart , I wanted to -- I wanted to hurt her . I -- I wanted to kill her . @!Adam: Liza -- @!Liza: So there you have it . You have everything you need . @!Adam: I need for what ? @!Liza: No judge in the world is going to let me keep my daughter . You 'll get full custody . @!Adam: Liza -- @!Liza: Adam , I -- I know you 'll get her . But , please -- please do n't . Please do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me . Please do n't take her , Adam . Please . Please . # @!Maria: You sure this is where you parked your car ? @!Aidan: Yeah . It 's right over there behind those trees . You do n't want to talk about this , then ? @!Maria: You know , if you 're so anxious to talk , why do n't you tell me what you thought you were going to accomplish back there . # @!Hayley: Jamie Lynn , you 're , like , 20 years old and you 've written a book . And I love the title -- it 's called " Wise Girl . " There it is . Is it autobiographical ? @!Jamie-Lynn It is , and I wrote this book just strictly to help people . I 've had a couple experiences in my life , particularly an eating disorder , and it chronicles every stage -- how I fell into the disease , how I got out , and how I deal with it now . @!Hayley: I was -- very interesting in here . I was reading this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise for hours on end . @!Jamie-Lynn I did . It was more of a control issue than anything for me , but it ended up spinning out of control . @!Hayley: And so you got involved with the National Eating Disorder Association . Did they contact you or did you contact them -- @!Jamie-Lynn I actually contacted them because I wanted to take a bigger role in the prevention and awareness . But it ended up being a wonderful thing for me because it was very therapeutic to constantly remind myself , as I was speaking out , about what I 've been through and how much happier I am right now . @!Hayley: Have you gotten a lot of reader reaction ? @!Jamie-Lynn I have . I 've gotten a lot of letters and e-mails from young girls telling me how nice it was to have somebody they could relate to . @!Hayley: Yeah . @!Jamie-Lynn So it 's been really rewarding . @!Hayley: It has to be very fulfilling to know you have such an influence over these young girls . @!Jamie-Lynn Absolutely . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really widespread , so it 's nice to know I 'm taking part in the situation . @!Hayley: Was there a specific instance or person or thing that happened to you that let you know that , you know , " this is , like , hitting rock bottom , this is it , I have to do something " ? @!Jamie-Lynn It built up over time , but there was a certain point where I almost became suicidal because it all just seemed like too much . And that was a time for me to step back and say , " ok , now I 've got to do something about this . " @!Hayley: Hmm . Well , it 's really -- it 's an incredible book . I can not -- I ca n't believe I 'm getting a time cue already , but I want to thank you so much . I know you do n't need it , but best of luck to you with everything -- @!Jamie-Lynn Thank you . @!Hayley: And especially with " Wise Girl . " It 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece , you do n't know what to get them for the holidays , I suggest Jamie Lynn 's book , " Wise Girl . " And thank you so much for being here .

And if I had known that you 'd already gone after the guy before , I would never have vented to you in the first place ! @!Aidan: For the last time , I only scared him . I did n't bruise him or even put a nick in his precious little skin . @!Maria: Ok , but if I had shown up -- if I had n't shown up when I did , would you have only scared him ? @!Aidan: You wanted justice . @!Maria: So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was solving a problem . @!Maria: Well , do your solutions always include a hammer or poison ? @!Aidan: Whatever 's necessary , I do it . # @!Liza: I do n't know what I would do without her .

Right now ? @!Kenny: Now , with the few charges they have against you , the best you could possibly hope for is a suspended sentence . @!David: I can avoid doing jail time altogether ? @!Kenny: Possibly , but you 'd definitely pull some kind of community service . @!David: Like what ? @!Kenny: Could be picking up trash .

It 's not what I did , not with you . @!Bianca: You know what ? I 've heard just about enough of this , and I think I 'm going to be sick . @!Lena: No , no , do n't go . You 're wrong , Bianca . @!Bianca: Just smile . Just whisper anything in my ear . You know I 'm going to believe you . Let go of me . @!Lena: No , I wo n't , I ca n't . # @!Kendall: So Michael thinks that we 're working together , that I 'm keeping quiet about his agenda while mine remains -- @!Boyd: Toppling Erica and becoming the Goddess of Enchantment . @!Kendall: Sounds like me , does n't it ? Well , as long as Michael thinks I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm safe . @!Boyd: Look , I do n't know , Kendall . I mean , I still think you 're taking a big risk playing double agent . What if Michael finds -- @!Kendall: No , trust me , it 's worth it . It 's worth it . I ca n't wait to ambush that lying pig , to see his little face when he learns that I would join forces with Erica just to bring him down . @!Boyd: Look , Kendall , I 'm not kidding , ok ? If Cambias finds out about your little plan , he 's going to come after you . @!Kendall: You 're worried about me . @!Boyd: Yeah , I am , ok , and you should be , too . @!Kendall: You care , even after all the awful things I 've done to you ? @!Boyd: Look , I know that was n't you . Ok , I know you . I know it was Michael . @!Kendall: Well , you can relax , ok ? The only thing I 'm going to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky , maybe your respect , too . @!Boyd: Yeah , well , you 've already got that . @!Kendall: I do ? @!Boyd: Yeah , you do . And I want to help . If you 're going to take Michael down , I want in . # @!Jack: So , Janelle , you do n't know for sure that Reggie 's withholding information about who shot me . @!Janelle: I would n't be surprised if he was . Has he told you anything about his family ? @!Jack: Not much . I know he 's got a couple of sisters . @!Janelle: His older brother , George , was shot a few years back , in the chest . @!Jack: Just like me . @!Janelle: And he was left in an alley , also like you . @!Jack: Who shot him ? @!Janelle: Someone that did n't like him talking to the cops . He had witnessed a crime , and he told the police everything he knew . @!Jack: I appreciate you telling me this , Janelle . It explains a lot . @!Janelle: But there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make it . He 's dead . # @!Reggie: So it was a party and there was drinks . A shot of liquor would n't kill you . @!Joni: No , there 's nonalcoholic punch , too . @!Reggie: And you were drinking it down . @!Joni: Yeah , because I did n't know that some idiot had spiked it with Ecstasy . @!Reggie: You were on X ? @!Joni: No , no , they put it in my drink . @!Reggie: Yeah , sure . That 's your story . You liked the high , do n't you ? @!Joni: No -- I do n't know because I passed out , and I went into a coma . @!Reggie: No way . @!Joni: No -- yeah , I did , and I felt like one of those kids in the commercial where , you know , " It takes one hit and you can die " thing . I do n't know . Everyone else turned out just fine . @!Reggie: So how come you got so ripped ? @!Joni: I guess -- well , I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Reggie: Oh , we 're to the God part now ? You want me to pray ? @!Joni: The doctors told my parents I was n't even expected to live . I mean , if I lived , I would turn out like a vegetable , and my parents -- they did n't freak out , they prayed for me , and they had everyone at church praying for me . And the whole time they just -- they begged God to use my body as an instrument to -- to , you know , convince people of the power of his love . @!Reggie: And here you are today ? @!Joni: Hey , three weeks later , I -- I woke up because of that , and the doctors could n't even explain it , not -- not medically . @!Reggie: Oh , so you 're a miracle ? Am I supposed to be impressed ? @!Joni: Reggie , prayer works . I am living proof of that . @!Reggie: So what happens to the people that get prayed for that do n't wake up ? What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as important to God ? @!Joni: No , everybody is equally as important and loved by God . Everybody . @!Reggie: So why do n't you tell that to my brother , ok ? Oh , yeah , you ca n't , because my brother 's dead . I guess I was n't speaking your God 's language that day . I mean , I guess the big man just did n't want to be bothered . # @!Bianca: What do you hope to accomplish with this , Lena ? @!Lena: Bianca , I am not prepared to lose this . @!Bianca: What , all the cash that you 're going to kiss good-bye when Michael finds out that I 'm on to you ? @!Lena: Listen , for the first time in my life I 've found something , someone who 's changed my life . @!Bianca: You 're talking about Michael Cambias , right ? @!Lena: You .

I feel just like you do . @!Bianca: I thought you did , but -- @!Lena: I do . Bianca , you are all that matters to me . I love you . # @!Edmund: You know there 's nothing I would n't do to keep my daughter safe . @!Maria: I know you would die for her . And so would I , but I just do n't think that that 's going to stop this guy . @!Edmund: There 's no way that murderer is getting near her . @!Maria: His safety hinges on shutting her up . @!Edmund: It 's possible that maybe -- maybe him being so close to getting caught just scared him off , you know . @!Maria: Edmund , I think that he 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now scoping out the place . @!Edmund: If he does that , it 'll be the biggest mistake of his stupid life , because I 'll be there waiting for him . @!Maria: What ?

Me , my mother , and my sisters , we kneeled all night in this chapel . You know , we prayed , we cried , and we begged . But we got screwed . Well , George did , anyway . But , you know , maybe we got our wires crossed , huh ? Maybe we did n't get heard by your God . @!Joni: I -- I guess we ca n't always understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my family went through more challenges than you could ever dream of . We needed a miracle , Joni , but I guess your God could only give out a certain number of those a year , right ? Yeah , I think that 's it . @!Joni: Can you -- can you take any comfort in knowing that that was God 's will ? @!Reggie: God 's will ? You think , I mean , for his own private reasons that he wanted my brother dead ? Thanks a lot , Joni . I feel a lot better .

@@5793297 Chuck Houston was the kind of man who wore his medals on the inside as well as the outside . Chuck was shot 178 times in the movies . But it was in World War II that Chuck became a real hero . He was a real star . He was wounded when , without regard for personal safety , he heroically thrust himself between an exploding grenade and his platoon , and , uh ... saved most of their lives . This was in the South Pacific , earning him the Purple Heart . - You 're 93 seconds too long . - Oh , damn ! - We 'll fix it . - You run a tight funeral . Well , the service ends at 12:15 , we close casket , and if you can cut 93 seconds from your tribute , we 'll be home free . I 'll work on it .

Nice joke , darling , but I only have a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story I 'm working on for Sunday night 's broadcast . It 's about a once-handsome , never-was actor from England , did n't make it here either , who gets a job in a Hollywood mortuary . The mortician takes a liking to him and the actor becomes a mortician himself , only our boy undertaker gets greedy . He realises morticians can get to the bodies before anyone else , can find telltale traces of homosexuality , affairs , drugs . So he begins selling his information to a television reporter , who also becomes his oh-so-secret lover , until he unceremoniously dumps her . - That 's old news . - Oh , this is even older . - I shot this just a few days ago . - It 's the Dorothea Page mansion . I knew you 'd recognise it . Just as I know you 'll remember what was around Dorothea 's neck when her body arrived here some years ago . Eric , what ratings do you think I 'll get for a story about a Hollywood mortician who steals a diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fancy mortuary ? - Sounds fascinating . - Does n't it ?

This is n't blackmail . I 'm broadcasting this Sunday night at eight , live . I 'm even having a party at my house to celebrate . This is my big surprise scoop of the year . Have n't told a soul . - I wanted you to be the first to know . - Thank you . You 're going to lose everything . Eric Prince - you used to be every widow 's bedroom pet .

She comes home , comes in here , pours herself a drink , off with the earrings , off with the shoes . You see the shoes ? I got the shoes . Yes , Sergeant ? She sits down , starts to work the computer . Doorbell rings . She gets up to answer it , there 's a struggle , someone nabs her sometime after 8:40 . After 8:40 ? Why 8:40 ?

A cheap , two-bit importer of knock-off Korean knitwear . Our divorce was gon na be final in a week , and if he 'd waited seven days to kick it , I would n't have to be here doing this . I do n't want a service , I do n't want flowers and I do not want a coffin . Mrs Lerby , your husband requested a cremation . There has to be a container . That 's the law . He was a 98lb weakling on his best day . What you got in there now you could put in a shoebox ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could cremate your husband today in one of our inexpensive cardboard boxes , place his ashes in an urn that I hope you will like - it 'll be ready tomorrow ... then arrange for our helicopter service to disperse the ashes over the ocean at our expense , with my compliments . - We 're going to take good care of him . - Well , better you than me . Interesting woman . I 'll cremate Mr Lerby 's remains myself as soon as they arrive . They come in at three , but you 'll have to wait before you put him in the oven . - Why ? - It 's being repaired . One of the gas jets blew yesterday when you cremated Mr Houston . - Did it ? How long will it take to fix ? - Repairman said it could be all day . - Tell me immediately when it 's ready . - Yes , sir . Oh , by the way , someone 's waiting for you in the display room .

Yeah , OK . - What kind of car was she driving ? - I assume the usual one . A red Mercedes . Uh-huh , red Mercedes . Sir , this is Miss Chandler 's datebook .

You said you always call Miss Chandler regarding VIP funerals . I was just at the Chandler house and we checked her answering machine . There were only three messages since yesterday , all from her secretary . No , sir , there was no message from you regarding Dan Riley 's funeral . - I must reprimand myself . - Well , do n't worry about it , sir . When you 've got your mind on big things , goodness , you could forget anything . Do you mind if I take one , sir ? My wife and I got ta make a decision on this stuff . With pleasure .

Please come in . - Careful here . - What happened ? We 're not sure , ma'am . That 's why I want to ask you a couple of questions . I hate to do this to you , ma'am . It 's routine , you might say . Routine . - Yes , to the usual suspects . - What has happened ? The questions that I want to ask you ... and we 're gon na be asking everybody that saw Miss Chandler yesterday the same questions ... and the question is where were you from about eight o'clock last night until seven this morning ? We 'll start with you , sir . Were you at home ? As a matter of fact , I was n't at home . Not at home . Uh , could you elaborate on that , sir ? Well , Lieutenant , I 'm a bachelor . Shall we say that I spent the evening with a friend ? With a friend . I hate to be indelicate , sir , but for my investigation , it 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . - Specifics , yes . - All right . All right . - Ma'am ? Mr Prince spent the evening with me at my house . - With you , ma'am ? - Yes . - At your house ? - Yes . Uh-huh . Yes , it 's been a very vulnerable and difficult time for Mrs Houston . She was prostrate with grief , and I felt it was necessary ... So Mr Prince came over to my house ... and he gave me grief counselling . Yes , I did . So you counselled Mrs Houston right through till this morning ? Mm-hm . Mr Prince came over shortly before eight o'clock and ... Well ... here we are . Lieutenant , do you have a moment ? Excuse me , please , Liz . Lieutenant ? Uh , the confidence that we 've just shared I imagine will go no further . Absolutely , sir . That is your business . Thank you . I appreciate that very much . Yes . Oh , ma'am ! I have a question for you . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ? All this ... Well , it 's given me the shakes . Well , I 'm sure if Miss Chandler were here , she 'd be pleased to share them with you . - Help yourself . - Thank you . Just do n't touch the Scotch . Do n't worry . Scotch is not my flavour . I prefer bourbon . Did you say something about a question ? Yes , ma'am . You know , I 'm a dog person and I can usually tell another dog person . - And I bet you 're a dog person . - Well , are n't you clever ? - I do have a couple of beauties at home . - All right . Now , you 've got a 12-week-old puppy , like Miss Chandler , for three days , and you leave at ten in the morning and you come back at eight at night . Would you forget to feed him ? Never . Well , that pup was not fed . His food was in the fridge . Until my dying day , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry puppy waiting for her . With the mess in the hall , maybe someone kidnapped her before she could feed him . She 's a smart girl . Could I trouble you ? Could you come over here , near this desk ? This is where Miss Chandler worked . Now , uh ... these shoes . Were these the shoes she was wearing at the funeral ? Her shoes were black . Yes , I would say so . Well , they were down here . OK . Uh , and these earrings . Were these the earrings she was wearing at the funeral ? Now , I know a lot about earrings and I particularly remember them . - Yes . These are the ones . - Uh-huh . This glass was here . That 's Scotch . So it looks like it was obvious that this is where she was , and , uh ... I only have one ... Excuse me , ma'am . Would you turn your head toward the light ? That lipstick , ma'am . Would you say that that shade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Yes . - That shade , does it have a name ? - Well , I think it 's called Afternoon Delight . - Uh-huh . Mr Prince , sir , did you see Verity kiss Chuck Houston ? - I do n't recall that . - Oh , she did . - And frankly , I thought it was a bit showy . - Well , your employee Rita saw it , because apparently she wiped the lipstick off of Mr Houston 's face . And she did it with this handkerchief . This stain , ma'am . How would this compare ... with the lip print on the glass ? - It 's not the same . - Yeah . That 's what I thought . Yeah . I happened to look into this pocketbook . This is the pocketbook that she was carrying at the funeral . And sure enough ... this lipstick . And this lipstick ... matches the lipstick on this handkerchief . So this lipstick is the lipstick that she was wearing during the day yesterday . Question : Why , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her day lipstick and put on dark evening lipstick to sit here alone , by herself , and type ? - Would you do that , ma'am ? - Oh , well , I 'm a little confused . You know , they told me they think she was working on this computer at 8:40 , and maybe she was , I do n't know , but they also tell me you push the right buttons right now - do n't ask me what they are ... you can erase that 8:40pm and put in 11:30am last Christmas , so who knows ? " Only the Shadow knows . " Fascinating . You certainly have a way with you , Lieutenant . Is there anything else you require of us at the moment ? Not at this time , sir . - Sir ! - Yes ? I 'm sorry . Sir ? Sorry , sir . Uh , ma'am ? I 'm sorry , ma'am . You 're late , ma'am . Forgive me . This 'll just take a second . I just forgot . Uh , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... no , I ca n't say that I 've ever seen that before . - Have you ever seen this ? - No . No , I haven't . - Sorry , Lieutenant . Ca n't help . - All right . Thank you very much . - Bye-bye again . - Bye-bye . Mr Lerby , we hardly knew you . A freshly repaired oven awaits you . Gentlemen , I fear this is for double occupancy . - Hey , Freddy . What have you got for me ? - I got nothing . - What 's this ? Soft time ? - But you got a visitor . - Eddie Fenelle ? - Yeah . - You drive cab 953 ? - Yeah . - So what 's the beef ? - Sit down . The dispatcher says your cab picked up a fare three days ago in Beverly Hills ... a woman named Verity Chandler . Drove her to a funeral home . Oh , yeah . I do n't remember her name , but I picked her up around 11:30 , dropped her off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home ? - No . - You did n't wait for her ? - No . - How 'd she leave the funeral home ? - How should I know ? Maybe she bummed a ride from another friend or called another cab . Did she have this picture ? Hey , look , she did n't jump in the front seat with me . We did n't get that close . - Are we done now ? - We 're done . - How long you been out ? - How 'd you know I was in ? I heard you say " soft time " . That 's prison slang for easy duty . - Six weeks . I 'm on parole . - Keep your nose clean . I 'll keep it so clean , you can eat off of it . I 'm going for a burger . Anything happens , page me . - Right . - Hey , nice talkin ' to you . Phew . Hell , man ! It is bumper to bumper out there . - You waiting on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Looking for a job ? No , just sitting and thinking . Sitting and thinking . Well , that 's a good thing if you do n't like to eat . But if you like to eat , not much time for sitting and thinking . Got ta burn rubber . - " HB " . What does that mean ? - Uh , Hollywood Boulevard . Hollywood Boulevard ... HB . SB . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , I 'm a cop ! I 'm a cop , you monkeys ! A thousand pardons , Lieutenant . You must forgive my security people . The bodyguards my country provides are professional , but they can be overzealous in their task . Now , what can Sheikh Hirami do to help the Los Angeles Police ? Sir , I 'm looking into a missing-persons case ... a woman named Verity Chandler . Verity Chandler ? I have never heard this name . She 's a kind of TV reporter . Ah , television ! Sheikh Hirami scoffs with derision . You do n't like television ? Television is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars . - Ah , good . Sheikh Hirami bought this mansion because it belonged to the movie star Miss Dorothea Page . Dorothea Page ... Yes ! A great silent-film star , became even bigger in the talkies . This was her place ? I 've lived here seven years , and I can not tell you ... the tourists , the gawkers . That is why the security . You know , of course , when Miss Dorothea Page died , the police came too . - Why ? - Surely you must know . The case of the mysterious missing diamonds . Diamonds ? Uh , sir , maybe I will show you this photograph . - What 's the ruckus ? - A thousand pardons . They are upset because just three days ago , they chased away a woman who took a picture . Wait a minute . This woman who took this picture , did she wear a big hat ? - Was that a yes ? - Big , black hat , red clothes . Very red . Are you saying the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red clothes , three days ago , took the picture and then drove away ? Yes . She got out , stole a photograph with her camera and then jumped right back into a taxi . - Taxi ? ! - Yes , they said taxi . Hey , I 'm not for hire . Hey , ca n't you read ? The sign says no smo ... Oh , it 's you . Hey , listen , I 've already got a fare . The dispatcher tells me you pick up the same guy from the same doctor at the same time each week . Right , and the meter 's running . What 's up ? Eddie Fenelle , aka Eddie the Fence . Six years , grand larceny , receiving stolen goods . Does that include a diamond necklace once worn by a star , Dorothea Page ? Hey , you ca n't pin that diamond job on me . I got a witness can identify you as the driver of this cab on the day that Verity Chandler ... took this photograph . Now , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown ? I 'm not looking to hurt you , Eddie . And right now I do n't need any definites . All I need is maybes . - Maybes ? - Yeah , maybes . OK , maybe . So maybe there is somebody who did know something about those diamonds . This somebody did n't steal ' em , he just handled ' em , if you know what I mean . And then maybe this somebody went to prison for another job , then when he got out of the joint , he gets a call from a woman . She says she 's a reporter and she wants the lowdown on those diamonds . And maybe somebody got some money for this information . Maybe . And maybe somebody 's cab was used to drive somebody to the dead movie star 's house to take a picture . - Maybe that too . - And maybe ... Come on , Eddie . I 'm waiting ! Maybe she wants this somebody to finger the guy who stole the diamonds . - How would she do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy . Bingo . Uh , that is not an official bingo , you understand ? That 's a maybe . But somebody identified this man in this picture as the man who fenced the diamond necklace belonging to Dorothea Page . Sounds right . Maybe . - Hey , here comes my fare . - Keep that nose clean . The service that we provide is a business , but how many businesses experience the whole gamut of human emotions ? Grief , pain , anger . Some of us call ourselves funeral directors . I prefer the old-fashioned word " undertaker " . I undertake the pain of the bereaved that they can not bear . Our business is based on trust , and without that trust , we lose our business . So it is in the spirit of that trust that I accept these awards and thank you all from the bottom of my heart . Thank you . Move over here a little bit . Let me take that , and look at the camera . Thank you . Thank you . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Hey , John . How 's everything , huh ? Good . Great speech , sir . Your office said that I 'd find you here . - This is not a bad time , is it ? - No . Always a pleasure . You intrigue me . - I wanted to tell you it was n't Sonny Bono . - Excuse me ? - I said it was n't Sonny Bono . - It was n't him ? - No , sir . Or Sandra Bullock . - It was n't her ? No , sir . It was n't even Steven Boohoo . - Who was it ? - You wo n't believe this . My cousin ... - It was him ? - No . My cousin works for a cab company . Drives a cab , and I went down to see him . They 've got this big map of the city and he 's writing on the blackboard , " Heavy traffic , HB " . " What 's HB ? " He says , " Hollywood Boulevard . " Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunset Boulevard ! - Very good . - We 're off to the bar . You joining us ? - In a few minutes . Have yourself a ball . - You bet , sir . - See you later . It might be an idea if we went somewhere private where we could chat . Follow me . - This cousin of yours , you see him often ? - Once a month . That should cover any fresh news he has for you . Is he on your mother 's side ? - No , sir . On my father's . - Oh , on your father 's side . I see . Lieutenant , you appear to have something on your mind . What 's bothering you ? A couple of those photos you took on the stand were OK , but ... this is the man I would trust . I 'm flattered . If you would n't mind stepping over here . I think this will provide adequate privacy . A nice , comfortable seat . If you 'd care to step in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there something in there , sir ? Have no fear . It 's just for display . Empty as a tomb . Yes . Do you always carry that paraphernalia with you ? - Sir ? - Those trappings . All the things that you pull out of your pockets . You know , that Sunset Boulevard thing , it is intriguing . - It is , is n't it ? - Yeah . Oh , here we are . " 12 noon Houston fun PH SB . " None of the SBs we thought up . Now , phone . PH - do n't tell me that that 's " phone " ? - Photo . - Photo . Photo . Oh , yes . And you did show us a photo of a house . There must be some connection . - I found the house . - On Sunset Boulevard ? - There it was , sir , big as life . - Fascinating . Did you thank your cousin ? I did , sir . I gave him three golf balls , but he 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was her house , sir . She died there . Dorothea Page . One of my idols . Oh , she was one of the greats , sir . A detective , Big George Tuddell - he 's an old friend of mine ... he told me that when she died , there was a million-dollar diamond necklace on her body . I can remember the very night . It was a Sunday , September 19 ... 79 . Her body was brought to the funeral home . - You were there ? - Yes . - At the home ? - Yes . I was there . - Wow . - It was after midnight . I was working late . We had four big funerals the following day . I had a lot of preparation to do . And then the phone rang . Dorothea Page had died , could the body be collected . So I sent the ambulance and I just sat there devastated , reliving my memories of her . Then the ambulance returned , the body was brought in and then the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They said that inadvertently a diamond necklace had been left around her neck before she was taken to the ambulance and had I found it ? So I said , " Of course not . " - You had n't pulled back the covers yet ! - Exactly . So I told them I 'd go and check . So I ... I pulled the cover back and no necklace . Uh-oh . So I went back to the phone and I told the police the bad news and they said , " Do n't leave the premises . " - I 'll bet they were there in five minutes . - Two . - You let them search the mortuary ? - I insisted on it ! - They never found the necklace ? - Not to this day . - What a mystery , huh ? - Yeah . So what do you think really happened , sir ? Who stole that necklace ? In my opinion , to this day , I still believe it was the help . The help at her house . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was stained , it was soiled . No decent human being would let such a lady of class be seen in a rag . Eric , you 're the man of the year . We 're waiting for you . I 'll be with you in a minute , yes . Well , my public awaits . Would you excuse me , Lieutenant ? Oh , go right ahead , sir . Do you mind if I sit here for a moment ? Something just struck me . I have to think . Make yourself at home . Everyone , silence . Silence ! Thank you . Maestro , play ! ? For he 's a jolly good ... ? Undertaker ?

Not really . Miss , you got ta understand , Sam has n't been next to a warm body in years ! I wonder why . - What 's your name ? - Morticia ? Gentlemen , gentlemen . Gentlemen ! - Thank you . What is your name ? - I 'm Roberta , sir . Roberta , to make up for the charm and grace of my colleagues , kindly pour a round of drinks for the entire bar . That 'll be my treat . Does that include me , sir ? Please . Thank you . Just kidding , sir . I 'm still on duty . Sorry to bother you again , but I 'd be very grateful if , uh ... you could look at this . This is my night of honour . I would like to enjoy it . Oh , I understand that , sir . And I 'm gon na be out of your hair in a jiffy . " Report house security officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Took photo of Dorothea Page house three days before funeral . " - Sounds like we both know who . - Well , it had to be her , but why , sir ? Why would she do that ? - No idea . - It 's very disturbing , is n't it ? Very . I could really be on my way , sir , if you would kindly listen to this , too . Yes , I 'll listen to it . I 'm working on a story that 'll rattle a few skeletons . Watch this Sunday for grisly undertakings on Sunset Boulevard . Hmm . She certainly has a way with words . You 're talking about " grisly undertakings on Sunset Boulevard " - those words . I hope nothing serious has happened to Verity , but sometimes these tabloid journalists , they thrive on sensation . Right , sir . So what you figure is that she was gon na do one of those sensationalised tabloid TV stories on you and those missing diamonds . - What do you think ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . What about the photo of the house ? Did she take that to show her viewing audience as part of the TV show ? - So that 's what you think ? - Uh ... no , sir . She took that photograph ... to show to somebody at the funeral . Really ? Ladies and gentlemen , in honour of Eric Prince , mortician of the year , I dug up a little funeral medley for you all , and it goes a little like this . ? When a body meets a body in the dead of night ? Should a body hide a body ? ? Or cremate it tonight ? ? After the wake is over ? After we 've all gone home ? After the body 's buried ?

You know that he 's the one we all are here to see ? Dear Eric ? Come on along , come on along ? Let 's give the guy a cheer Very nice , my friend . Very nice . Thank you . Beautiful . Much as I loved her , I never did see Dorothea Page 's house . - Did anyone else recognise the photo ? - No , sir . No . - Not a soul . - What a shame . For a moment there , I thought you were onto something . All right , ladies and gentlemen , let 's liven things up a bit . This is a party after all . One , two , three , and ... Everybody , sing along . You left this in the hearse . I 'm sure you 'll wan na keep it with your other awards . My cousin 's got one just like it from the bowling league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lieutenant . You know , sometimes our business can be , shall I say , a little morbid . Believe me , sir , if I had your job , I 'd be doing this every night ! If she was following this diamond- necklace caper , she did n't tell me . - And you checked everything here ? - You bet . Not a mention of it anywhere . But here 's a really strange thing . All the staff have them . Verity always carried hers . - What is it ? - It 's a phone/pager combined . Here 's where you paged me to come over . - Oh , yeah . - " Lieutenant Columbo , 3:30 . " Now , here 's the really strange part . When the public have gossip , it usually comes in here - email ... then it 's transferred to her pager . Now , look at the screen . - What is " interrupted " ? - Cut off , gone , dead . What could have cut off her pager ... at 12:32 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's our remembrance package . That costs $47,000 . - Oh , I 'll remember that one ! - Of course , we have other options . Excuse me . Nice to see you again , Lieutenant . Mrs Lerby has come to take her husband to his final rest . - Our condolences . - Oh , jeez ! He 's heavier now than when he was alive ! Have you selected a place for dispersal ? Well , he was the king of double knit , so I think I 'll spread him over one of his stores . I think that Mrs Lerby is pulling our leg . The ashes will be dispersed over the ocean by our helicopter at eight tonight . Cremation - that might be the way to go . There 's no worms , but that 's hot , right ? - Let me show you the procedure . Please . - Oh , thank you . I 'm leaving now , but I 'll be back in good time for the service . Very fine , thank you . Boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a gurney , just like this one , and if I had to store you overnight , we 'd put you in here . It 's refrigerated . - Is that thing always locked ? - If a body is stored overnight , it is . We would n't want it to run away on us ! No , sir . Do all the employees have keys ? Uh , just me . Good afternoon . Welcome to my parlour . He 's interested in the cremation procedure . Is he ? Gerald , I 'm not too happy with the flower arrangement in the chapel . Would you check it out ? I 'll take over . Right away . Pleasure meeting you , Lieutenant . I 'll give you the tour . Here we have an injector tube for blood and formaldehyde . And here we have scalpels , needles and thread , putty , Pan-Cake makeup powder . A mortician not only has to be a surgeon , but also part-beautician and part-makeup artist . Now , this thing is called a choker . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that into you , attach the tube , to extract your combustible gases . It must be a funny job , sir , being a mortician . It has its moments . That is an indispensable piece of equipment . I do n't know what I 'd do without it . So you undress the body , then you do whatever you have to do with that stuff , dress it again . Then what ? In the box , in the coffin , in the casket . - Like that one there , sir ? - Yes , a very popular model . - Could two people fit in there ? - Afraid not . What do you have in mind ? It 's a crazy thought , sir . The wife and I , we do everything together . - Nah , forget it . Where 's the oven ? - The oven ? Here 's our little oven . What we do is up with the door ... in you pop , turn on the heat and away you go . - What heat would that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't even like sunburn . - When it 's finished , is everything gone ? - All gone . - And one person can run the oven ? - Yes . - A whole body can fit into one of those ? - A human being is mostly water . A man of your size would probably burn down to about 5lbs . Oh , I forgot something . Yes , the Dan Riley , uh ... the Dan Riley ceremony . These are his dancing shoes . They 'll be buried with him . - Would you care to see ? - Yes , I would , sir . Yeah . - Everything would burn in that oven ? - Of course , there are exceptions . You ca n't cremate pacemakers , for instance . They 're made of titanium . - Mr Houston , he did n't have one , did he ? - No . That 's much better , Gerald . You and Hugo can go now , but do check everything before the service . - It shall be done , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , these are placed in the casket before the casket is closed . Sir , in case you were wondering , Miss Chandler , she did n't wear a pacemaker . - I was n't wondering . - Yeah , but she did have one of these . This is a ... a pager . She had this model , sir . Oh , she carried this everywhere , probably in her pocket , and this would tell her when she received email messages from the computer . And on the day she disappeared , she received messages , oh , let 's see ... 11:13 and 11:57 , but then , at 12:32 ... the pager cut off . - No more signals . Kaput . - What do you think caused that ? Oh-ho ! Ah ! That is a burning question , sir . - I think she was dead . - Really ? Yeah . I think she was killed right here at the Houston service . - What would the killer do with the body ? - He would get rid of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cremation that day . I did it . Yes , so the killer would have had to have switched the bodies ... switched Chuck Houston with Miss Chandler . I see . So if he had switched the bodies , that would explain the pager going kaput . Yes , sir . It would . I see . Well , since there was only one cremation that day and I performed it , that would make me the murderer . Do tell me , do you have any bodies ? No , sir , I do n't . So if you do n't have any bodies , you ca n't prove there was a switch . - No , sir , I can't . - No bodies , no case . Mm-hm . I suppose so . That 's the tricky thing about burning questions ... once they 're burned , they 're just ashes . Ashes ! Have you gone ? That 's a nice display , ma'am . My housekeeper made that . If I 'd done it , they 'd all be cockeyed , like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little ol ' ranch house . 800 acres . Chuck just craved it for his horses , like I crave my bourbon . Oh , my God ! Are you all right , ma'am ? I 'm psychotic , Lieutenant . I should get disaster aid , like Chuck . Poor darling , he was wounded so many times in the war . Oh , you should 've seen his x-rays . They were grisly . He only mounted one , the one on the wall . The one that made him limp till the day he died . You wan na know why I 'm like this ? Because when you called and said you 'd be here in an hour , I just had to help myself to a few cocktails because I know why you 're here . I just wanted to ask you a few questions . All right . I confess . I confess ! I throw myself on the mercy of the court . I did it ! Did what , ma'am ? I threw Chuck 's ashes over the sign - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , ma'am , and that 's not ... good . Oh . I only did it because I thought he 'd like it . - Am I gon na do time ? - You told me the best confession ever . I did ? Are you gon na arrest me ? I 'm going to arrest you , ma'am , like no one has ever been arrested before . He was a great artist , ladies and gentlemen . And now a special tribute that I know Dan would appreciate . Beautiful . Just beautiful . Thank you . - But I did n't come here for the service , sir . - That 's a pity . But I have to speak to you , sir , tonight . - This is not the time , nor the place . - When and where , sir ? This service will be over soon . I 'll be working late . In my office at nine . - That should fit in very well . At nine ? - Yes . I 'll leave the gate open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office is on the right . There 's a sign . - Left , right , a sign , and you 'll be there ? - Yes ! Thank you very much , sir , and I 'm sorry about the intrusion . Yes ! You sure know how to send somebody away in style . Come in . - Good evening . Right on time . - Oh , tea for two . I thought it might be appropriate after that service you attended today . I hope you ... - Pull up a chair . I hope you like tea . - Oh , it 's my wife 's favourite , sir . Splendid . And help yourself to milk and sugar . Oh , very nice , sir . Very nice indeed . These tongs - very nice . My wife , she uses a spoon . Does she ? Oh , very nice . - Nice . Never tasted anything like it . - Darjeeling . I 've been chasing guys like you for 25 years . Caught every one , except you . - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the one about the wealthy old lady ? Hated her kids , but loved the dog . - I 'm afraid not . - The dog always wore a rhinestone collar . And when the old lady died , the kids could n't find the money . It disappeared . Eight years later , the dog died . It was cremated . Nothing left except a mound of ashes and a $450,000 pile of diamonds . So that was n't a rhinestone collar the dog had on . No , sir . No . That was a $450,000 diamond collar . Fascinating . You see , sir , diamonds do n't burn . But you already know that , sir . That 's why you took Dorothea Page 's necklace off her dead neck , opened her mouth and dropped it down her throat , so you could cremate the body the next day and take the diamonds out of the oven and put ' em in your pocket . Why am I telling you this ? Because it makes me feel good . I got ta get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrest tonight , but I ca n't lay a finger on you , sir . I have n't understood one word , but that last part about the finger , I like that . It sounded good . What 's that thing doing here tonight ? - Oh , that 's gon na land , sir . - Is it ? - Yeah , that 's landing . - I 'll go check on it . Uh , sir , hold on just one minute . Let me take another sip of this beautiful tea . Oh , these tongs , sir , they 're really special . Why do n't you keep them ? Save your wife using the spoon . Thank you very much . That 's very nice . Oh , yeah , these , uh ... They could come in useful . Are you ready ? I 'm ready now , sir . Hey , guys , switch on your headlights and those sidelights ! - Let 's get some light on this thing . - Yes , Lieutenant . - What 's Mrs Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? She spread ashes over the Hollywood Hills . That 's against the law . - Oh , Eric , I 've been such a fool . - Yes , it 's all going to be all right . Maybe , if you 'll tell the judge that the warning about it 's against the law is in very fine print . If you 'll do that , that could help her . - It shall be done . - All right . Ma'am , return to the police car . Now , go . - Just precisely what is going on here ? - Oh , it 'll all be all right , sir . Just to verify , did you cremate Mr Houston at 12:20pm Thursday afternoon ? - I did . - Very good . Uh , you , sir ! The pilot ! They tell me they call you Joe . Come on over here , Joe , and bring that bag with you . - Are you from the Prince Funeral Home ? - Yes , sir , I am . And on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard your copter and tell you to fly over the Hollywood sign ? - Yes , sir , she did . - Did she dump those ashes over the sign ? - She did . - I 'll take that bag , thank you . - Did you report that ? - No , sir , I did n't . All right . Report to the squad car , please . Thank you very much . The name " Lerby " written here , did you write that when you cremated the body ? - Yes , I did , but how the blazes ... - I radioed the pilot , ordered him back . His license is in jeopardy . Ma'am , I 'm Lieutenant Columbo . We met this morning . - I got ta confiscate your husband 's ashes . - Oh , no . He 's like a bad penny . - Was your husband a war hero ? - War hero ! He was never in any war . - Never served ? - No , he was 4-F , like everything in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cos I 'm thinking of Chuck Houston , who was not only a movie idol , he was a legitimate war hero . Fought all across the Pacific , was wounded , hospitalised , endured pain . You should see his x-rays . He even had ' em framed . Walked with a limp to the day of his death . Now , Mr Prince , if you did cremate Chuck Houston on Thursday , as you claim , when Mrs Houston spread those ashes over the Hollywood Hills , Chuck and everything with him ended up on that hillside . But if you did n't ... if , instead , his body was switched ... I thought these might be useful . Chuck Houston had a piece of shrapnel in him . A piece of shrapnel made of stainless steel - hardest metal on earth , sir . Like titanium , it wo n't melt if you put 2,000 degrees on it . Hard evidence , very distinctive shape . I think the chances that this piece of metal will match Mr Houston 's x-rays are good . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr Houston 's 50-year-old war record ended up in the urn of a 48-year-old leisurewear importer from Sherman Oaks . Very good . Very , very good . - Would you excuse me , please ? - Where are you going , Mr Prince ? I 'm going to the police car . I 'm wondering whether we should travel separately , or perhaps you 'd care to join me . Well , that 's up to you , sir 
@@5126254 EDDIE : This was the battle ground . Here , where we lived and worked , is where we fought the enemy . And where those of us who remain on the blacklist continue to fight . A drab town , with a population of over 100,000 , where 61% of the houses are rented . 34% have no inside toilets . 29% no bathrooms . An ugly town . One book shop , two cinemas , pubs , betting shops and a rugby team . A battered landscape , scarred by years of exploitation going back to the time when coal was king . A company town dominated by a firm which has been run by the same family for 142 years , a family whose high moral purpose and paternalistic attitude is evidenced by the fact that every Christmas it offers to its pensioners a free bag of coal together with a contribution to their television licence . Up in this part of the country , they 've got it sewed up . If you do n't work with them , you might as well not work at all . There had n't been a strike here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a closed shop . Their contributions were automatically deducted from the workers'pay packets . And meetings were as rare as a sunny day on a wet weekend . Then it happened . ( ALLCLAMOURING ) BILLY : In the first place , it was our lads in the sheet works . The walked out at 11:30 over some minor discrepancy in the payslip , which was something that they 'd been complaining about for weeks . But it just seemed to snowball , like , suddenly it burst like a carbuncle that had been left festering . ( BANGINGGAVEL ) Fellas . I 'd like to introduce you to Bill Hagan , the official of the union . We 're down here to discuss this discrepancy of 30 shillings a week in the pay package . As far as I 'm concerned , Mr Chairman , the discrepancies in the payslips is a triviality . It 's something which we can sort out quite easily . What I want to know is what is Brother Hagan doing about our long outstanding claim for a two-and-sixpence an hour increase ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crown an hour , you must be bloody joking . - Surely . I 've got ... - ( ALLPROTESTING ) Wait a minute . Wait , wait . Wait a minute . Now , let me speak . Now , I 've been brought down here on one matter , which is the payslips . And now you 're throwing something at me which is entirely different , entirely different altogether . And I ca n't , as a union representative ... As a union official , I ca n't even discuss this with you at this level . I 'd like to ask Mr Hagan what has he been doing for the last eight months for this half a crown an hour ? What progress have you made towards getting this half a crown an hour ? I would like to convene a meeting of the shop stewards properly . Officially and not unofficially . And then if they declare a course of strike action , then we twist the arms of the National Executive and make it official properly . - ( ALLPROTESTING ) - MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come out with sevenpence ha'penny in two parts . Fourpence last November and thruppence ha'penny this May . That 's what they 've been messing about with . That rise has already gone on the rent increase of this year . - That 's right . - Hear , hear ! HAGAN : It 's all very well to sit there and say , " What have you done ? " We 've done a lot . We 've done a lot . ( @all_shouting ) CHAIRMAN : One minute , now . One at a time , now . This is the kind of answer we expect of a clown official of a bloody clown union . ( @all_cheering ) Mr Chairman . - You know perfectly well ... - Mr Chairman , please . What are we arguing over half a crown for ? I 've been in this firm now for 11 years . And do you know what my basic pay is ? Thirteen pound , five and eight a week . - Yes , but you earn more than that . - A bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say let 's go the whole hog . Twenty-five pound a week basic , without your overtime . ( @all_cheering ) ( INAUDIBLE ) That was asked for eight months since , and the official 's done nothing about it . Added time was asked for Christmas day and nothing has been done about that . - How do you know we 've done nothing ... - And nothing 's been done about this . So I propose , here and now , we strike . - HAGAN : How do you know ... - ( @all_agreeing ) Mr Chairman , Mr ... CHAIRMAN : Now we 're getting personal , now , brothers . Let 's keep to the questions . Do n't get personal . Never mind all the shouting and bothering , brothers , if we 're going to come out , let 's go out . And let 's make a good job of it . No more arsing about like we did last time . What are you talking about ? You were back through the gate first last time . Do n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're one of the biggest grabbers in the firm , you 've got more Sundays in than a parish priest , you have . ( @all_laughing ) You listen to me now . There 's only one way and that is the proper way , the way , the orderly way , the union way . Why should n't it go officially through this ? We have tried and tried and tried again . And the JIC is totally ineffective . It has come up with no positive result . And now we have to put the union in motion by getting pressure from the shop floor . This is the only way it can be done . We 've lost faith in you completely . ALL : Hear , hear . Mr Chairman , I put a proposition to you before , for you to put to the floor . You seem to be avoiding the issue . ( MENAGREEING ) I 'm going to put the proposition to the floor meself . Gentlemen , do you agree that we should all come out on strike for ? 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days , all six factories were at a standstill . And then all the other plants up and down the country in the Wilkinson Group came out in support . It was great ! I think we could have done anything . We could have stopped the world . BILLY : Well , what do you do when those who are supposed to be leading us , like , go out of their way to defeat it ? Brother Hagan declared it official at plant 's level . Yet no attempt was made to prevent stuff coming in and out of the factory . Likewise , nothing was done about gaining support from other unions . And so the men got bitter and angry about it . They began to suspect that he 'd only made it official in order to sabotage us . You know you 're crossing picket lines ? Come on , boy . Fetch it back . Go . I hope you know you 're crossing picket lines ! If you were n't here , then we could do it . Stand on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as you ! Get your hands off !

Jam buttie-gob . - You can smell it a mile away . - You at it again , rat-face ? Look , we 've got pickets here on the gates and they 're going in and out and they 're laughing at us . Look , I know it 's frustrating and we can understand it , Les , but it 's still no excuse for talking about throwing the towel in . - Oh , look , I did n't mean it that way . - Look , Hagan holds the reins .

( MENJEERING ) Now , now , now , now . Please . And they , after very careful consideration , have decided that although they have great sympathy - with what we say ... - ( @all_shouting ) Please ! They feel that this is the wrong way to go about things and that this is not an official strike . It 's a non-official strike . - The strike is unofficial . - ( ALLPROTESTING ) ( @angry_shouting ) - Get out of it ! - Listen . Now , it 's no use you getting onto me now . Whose bleeding side are you on ? What are you doing ? Leave him alone . ( @crowd_chanting ) ( @all_cheering ) Eddie Martin , Southside .

( @all_agreeing ) Before this day is out , I want some criticism at the platform on how this strike 's being run or not being run . But he 's been down to London . He promised you official support . At least listen to him . Listen to him ! You want to know what you 're up against . Give him a hearing . Give him a hearing . All right , Brother Hagan . Well , I 'd like to take Eddie up on a point or two here , you know . Some of the things he said . ( SHOUTING ) I know , the response has been magnificent from the floor . It 's been wonderful . And now you 've got this strength . Why do n't you use it ? Why do n't you let us negotiate for you ? ( @angry_shouting ) - And it 's completely wrong . - Make it official ! This is senseless . Really it is . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next National Executive have decided on a secret ballot . ( ALLDISAGREEING ) Listen , listen , listen , listen . You 're cutting your own throats . - HAGAN : Oh , the meeting 's over . - ( @crowd_shouting ) ( @crowd_booing ) ( @all_cheering ) Now , let 's stop out till we get our ? 25 for a fortnight . And take some action now ! ( CHEERING ) Well , now you see what we got to put up with , lads . MAN : They 're rubbish ! You just sacked the sell-out merchants . MAN 2 : It 's about time . - What are you going to do now ? - We 'll elect our own committee . EDDIE : All right , boys . Can we have those stewards who are prepared to back the rank and file and lead the strike ? Those who are coming forward , will you give your department in and your name so that the lads can identify you ? All right , let 's have those stewards , then , boys . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you come off the shop floor as well , boys , be prepared to serve on the committee or will you gamble this strike ? ( CHEERING ) - Les Sanders , Civil Works . - ( CHEERING ) - Jerry Smith , Flat Iron . - ( CHEERING ) - Frank Johnson , Main Plant . - ( CHEERING ) - Mike Reilly , Tower Head . - ( CHEERING ) I think that 's good representation , boys , but I believe that you want a few more on . It 's not top-heavy . All right , John ? ( PATRONSCHATTING , INDISTINCT ) By God , that 's not coming in here . Get that out . EDDIE : It 's a fine start to your first meeting . Ca n't help it , mate , if you ca n't get on the bus , can you ? I was there in time . Take a seat . There 's another one there . - Is he excused ? - Long as he does n't make a habit of it . We were discussing ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper form on the agenda . We 'll make an agenda out . Uh , the lads ... we 're in the middle of talking about this ... the ballot the lads were waiting for . Well , I ca n't see us cracking this one until first we give it a bit more thought . And if the unions do n't publish the results of the ballots , well , what can we do about it ? It seems to me as if it 's been an abortive ballot anyway , because I would say that if the result was for a return to work it would have been all over The Echo and the local paper , on the television and everything . I would think that the result of the ballot has been for the stay-out , to support us , and they have n't been prepared to publish it . Well , that 's the first step . Now , what about ... JERRY : There was something you said , or was mentioned before , Eddie , about ... For a bulletin , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , someone raised that before . - EDDIE : A bulletin ? Propaganda ? - Yeah . Yeah . I 'll tell you what , Eddie . I 'm might be able to get hold of a duplicator for you . I do n't really know . My missus , she 's in the Children of Mary . You know , she 's never away from church and she 's well in with the parish priest , Father Garnett . And he uses this for these church bulletins . You know , for births , marriages , deaths and all that malarkey . And I think if I twist her arm hard enough ... I wo n't tell him what it 's for , of course . - I 'm sure she 'll get it . - Will she get it for nothing ? My wife 's mate 's got a typewriter . I can borrow that . FRANK : Can you type ? No , but there 's nothing to it . - It 's just like playing the piano . - ( @all_laughing ) EDDIE : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the main spokesman on the pickets , Les . Yeah . What you want is good , big , hard-looking fellows . There 's no use having a ruddy little fellow . You want a good big fellow , just to explain , you give them the instructions and send them forward and they know what to do . Stop the men from going through and stop the wagons from going through . This is the main thing . Stop them from going in and if they do n't go in , they can not bloody go out , either . So that 's the main thing . Stop them from going in and we 'll win . EDDIE : What about this question , you know ... You start stopping wagons , you 're going to have the police involved . JOHN : There 's going to be violence . LES : Look , the police will be involved anyway . Well , you want a captain at the picket . What about you , Les ? - LES : Yeah , I would do it . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( @all_laughing ) - And Bert . LES : Yeah . That 'd be a good idea . EDDIE : Right . Well , that 's two points . What about these hardship cases you 're hearing all about ? - Some terrible ... - JERRY : Yeah . Lads in terrible trouble . I know six fellows thrown out their digs ' cause they got no money . Single lads , you see . LES : Ai n't it about time after 100 years that we had a war ? That 's the thing . A hundred years , nothing 's gone on . This is it now . We 're going to have a good go . ( GROANS ) - Hello , Charlie . - Hello , Mae . How are you ? - Oh , all right . Baby 's sick again . - Oh , it 's very cold today . Very . Very cold . Hello . Where you been ? For a nice little walk ? Eh ? - Yes . - How are you ? I wonder if you could help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 's one of them forms that the Rank and File Committee dished out . " I am at the present time unemployed due to a dispute at my place of work . " I am therefore unable to send my usual payment . " However , as soon as the dispute is settled , " I shall resume my payments " and make arrangements with you to clear my arrears that might be outstanding . " Now , I had one of them final warning notices that day , you know . - Pay-up-or-else kind of style . - I know . - Do you think that 'll do the trick ? - It should do the trick . It explains enough there , does n't it ? Yeah , I hope it does . You ca n't get blood out of a stone , you know . You helped us out when we was on the lump and when they was trying to get rid of these lump men , so we have to give you some support . You did everything you could for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grocer , Heath , did when he formed his government , he fetches in businessmen from outside industry ... - His super cabinet , you know . - Davis , CBI ... He 's a hatchet man . And they 've got the audacity to tell us that we should n't organise ourselves . What they want is docile sheep to be herded into the pen , led by a few handpicked Judas goats . Like TUC leaders and trade union leaders and the Harold Wilsons of this world and the Barbara Castles and all the phoney left . What paper are you from , then ? Well , I 'm from The Courier . It 's an East Lancashire paper , you know . - It prints the local news , like . - The Courier . - From The Courier . - What did they send you here for ? Well , they 've sent me here , but I mean , basically I 'm a gardening correspondent . I do n't know anything about strikes . They sent me here to follow up this strike of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me you 're a reporter from the Beano . All right , boys . Can you settle down there ? Brothers and sisters . ( PEOPLESPEAKING ) And comrades . And all our supporters . Uh , I must thank the boys who 've laid on this do tonight . You all know them , the Prickeys . Peter 's over there . And his mates . But he never only laid on this place , they laid on the committee rooms and paid for the place over here that launched your Rank and File Committee a week ago . And they 've also organised the collections among other building workers . He 's also brought along tonight one of his members to sing a few ditties . So it 's only left for me to tell you to drink up and listen to Jerry Fox . FOX : I 'd like you fellows to sing a song that 's a great old Irish rebel song . It 's calledThe Jolly Ploughboy .

This stuff , they 're importing it from Tibet . - Manure you mean ? - Well , it 's like a sort of manure . - You know . It 's ... - Yak shite , is it ? Well , if you like to put it that way , yes . # Oh Paddy dear , and did you hear the awful things they say # Princess Margaret and Lord Snowden , they have joined the IRA # ( @audience_laughing ) # They are drilling in the mountains to the sounds of the fife and drum # Young Tony 's taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie fires the gun , while young Maggie fires the gun # Young Tony 's taking snapshots while young Maggie fires the gun # ... job we go to .

I keep hitting the wrong bloody key . I hardly wonder . You leave it too late . Ca n't it wait till in the morning ? Whoever wrote this must have wrote it with a bloody yard brush . - Oh , I do n't care . - " Sophistry . " - What 's that supposed to mean ? - I 'm sick of you . I would n't know . I 'm not very interested in them sodding letters . It 's that what 's keeping you awake . - It 's got to be done . - Anyway , you 've changed your mind since you 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love , go on upstairs and I 'll follow you up . I thought me luck was in when you made a fuss of me . - Go on , I promise . - Oh , no , you say that . You 'll nod off asleep , then . And you sit up typing , well ... I think I 'll make meself a nice cup of tea . You want one ? Yes , go ahead , yeah . - Signed herself " Pericles " . - ( CUPKNOCKSONCOUNTER ) Who 's there ? It 's all right , it 's only me . You want a sandwich ? No . Sophistry . - I 'll go and get the lads ' dictionary . - Shh ! Do n't make a noise . You 'll wake the kids . ( BANGING ) Johnny ? Is that you ? Johnny ? - Les ! There 's someone in the yard . - What 's all the shouting about ? - There 's someone in that yard . - Are you sure ? - Face just at the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @glass_shattering ) - LES : You stay there ! Oh ! Watch it ! ( @dog_barking ) You lousy bastard ! All right , boys , the next thing on the agenda is the lobby . It 's been suggested when we 're in London that we should go down to see the ... lobby the Labour Ministers , Constituency Members , go down to the Head of the Social Security . - Well , you can stuff that . - MIKE : Why ? Well , we 're out of town lobbying MPs in London , right ? The way is clear here for the union to do a deal behind our backs . Look , the strike from beginning to end is one of politics . We must send a delegation down to the Houses of Parliament . We 've got to lobby the MPs . There 's no need to leave the front at home bare . We can send a delegation of maybe two , three or four members . And we can still leave people at home . - You 're acting very small about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ... Frank Malone , Stan Holme , Eric Heffer ... - People like them , you mean , do n't you ? - Yeah . ( LAUGHING ) MIKE : Look the thing is if you do n't pin them down , if you do n't nail them ... JERRY : It 's all about going down on spec . To possibly see somebody who 'll give you a cup of tea and say , " All right , lads . I 've heard it . Go back home . " EDDIE : And something good could result from this . JERRY : Name me a time any good 's come of it . All you 'll get if you go down there is a lot of sympathy . A lot of sympathy and nothing . You wo n't get a thing , not a thing . I 'm telling you , you go down there they 'll say they are very sorry , have a cup of tea , " Okay , boys , very good . " And they 'll send you back and what will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - MIKE : That 's if we accept that . They keep their mouths shut because it 's exactly what Frank said , it 's politics and they do n't want to know . ( @all_arguing ) Someone 's bound to fight our cause . To make a name for himself . JERRY : Name one ! They do n't make names by fighting about strikes . Of course they do . This is going to be ... JERRY : They make names by talking about blood sport . This has developed into a big issue . Never mind the blood sports . EDDIE : They say that at the top you should n't handle glass . That 's worth more than all the people speaking in the Houses of Parliament for us . Could this come about ? Do n't you think there is the remotest possibility ? Not a chance in hell . Political battles were never fought taking tea - on the terrace at House Of Commons . - Right . Now you know Labour MPs . Labour MPs have always had one job . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - That 's right . - They will never ... You go down to see them , right ? They 'll take ... If they see you . Send telegrams . Get there to see them . If they see you , they 'll offer sympathy . They might make a few speeches in Parliament about the hardship - the women are going through . - Yeah . But what will they do to mobilise support for us ? What will they do to organise ? What will they do to help us with funds ? What will they do to help us with the strike ? Win the strike ? Nothing . And that 's been the role of Labour MPs throughout history . - ( @telephone_ringing ) - What will we do ... They jump off the working class train when they get to Westminster and they can never get back on it . BILLY : The first thing you learn in politics is that there 's no such thing as a fair hearing . - ( @phone_ringing ) - EDDIE : You 've got to pressurise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ... Who ? Yeah , he 's here . Hang on . Hey , Bert . For you . JERRY : You see , Bert ... BERT : Who is it ? Newspaper fellow . He said he spoke to you last week . ( ALLTALKINGINBACKGROUND ) Hello ? Yeah , speaking . - Shh ! Hang on , fellows . Shh . - EDDIE : Hold on , boys , hold it . Yeah ? Well , we have n't heard nothing about it . No , no . No , no comment to make . Not till we find out what 's involved . Yeah , well , I can ring you back , ca n't I ? Yeah , well , just give us your number . Yeah . Okay , fair enough . I 'll ring you back later . Ta-ra . Well , that 's it , lads . Oh , dear . You can forget about your London bloody trip . That 's redundant . That 's the reporter . They 've had a meeting this morning , the management and the bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the union 's accepted it . - Bloody hell . - What right do they got to accept ? MIKE : Hey , it 's better than a kick in the arse , is n't it ? EDDIE : Look , that depends on the deal . Let 's be rational , boys . But that meeting ended hours ago . Why have they kept it secret ? There 's only one reason . They must be waiting for us to get out of town , then they 'll go and spring it on the lads . Will they put that to a meeting of the men , like ? - Not likely . - No , I do n't think so . He 'll probably line up a couple of tame shop stewards , put it to them , they 'll agree , he 'll have it on the leaflets , democratically , and give it back to us next morning . - We got to get out and get those posted . - Better get on the phone to Hagan and find out what strokes he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter have to say ? He told me enough to know that it 's not a straight deal . That they 've been offered ? 3 , he said , and there 's a lot of strings attached to it . What are we sat here gassing about ? Let 's get the posters out and get our own bloody meeting organised . You got the posters ? - Pick us up in about 10 minutes . - See you in about in 10 minutes . Here , grab that . Get on me back , come on . Get right on . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . - All right . You all right ? - Yes , go on . - Come on , John , hurry up . - Okay . You all right down there ? Come on , Jesus Christ . It 's gone in my eye and everything . - What the hell are you doing up there ? - The bloody thing keeps blowing away . I feel like the bleeding Hunchback of Notre-Dame here . Hurry up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in a minute . All right , I 'm coming in a minute . Hang on . - Just hold your horses . - I 'm going . - Hold your horses ! - I 'm going ! ( @both_grunting ) ( @all_chattering , INDISTINCT ) These are the facts as we see them , lads . You 'll be given the opportunity to vote . So read it . I hope you can all understand it . What if we work overtime , then , Eddie ? If you work overtime , you do n't get a sausage . - Not a bloody thing ? - You get the bare thing and that 's all . All right , lad ? Who 's the queer fellow over there ? - Here , toots . Give them out . - Yeah , all right . Made a good job of this , Eddie . Makes good reading . We never invented the sell-out . - Who 's this ? Another reporter ? - Now , now , Eddie , there 's no need to be like that . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie . Morning , brother . I 've been looking at your pamphlet here . It 's not very well worked out is it ? I mean , it 's a bit skimpy . You 've not got all the details there . You trying to say it has n't got all the true facts in it ? Come on , Eddie . I mean , you know as well as I do , you can make a pamphlet like this look like anything you need to . It 's either true or it 's a lie . Yes . But I mean it does n't take any account of the employer 's offer against the complex background in this case . I mean , you ca n't get that in a pamphlet like this . I mean , I ought to know . I have been dealing with employers - for years now , have n't I ? - That 's right , Eddie . - He 's had them tied up for years . - Who ? - The employers , who else ? - Well , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass meeting on now , brother . Here 's a chance to do your job . I 'm offering you the platform . Well , I 've spoken to the stewards already . They 've accepted . Aye , some of the stewards you have . But the stewards are here and the rank and file 's here . And I 'm offering Brother Ogby the platform . You know that Brother Ogby can not address that meeting . Certainly he can . Look , let 's be less constitutional and more democratic . That 's what he 's getting paid for . ( @cheering_and_applause ) Thank you ! - Good morning , brothers . - Good morning . Look . We are sorry we 're late , boys . But we were delayed at the start . We have two National Officers here . One National Officer rather , you know the other boy . - Brother Altmere ... - ( BOOING ) ... and Brother Hagan . - Now we 've invited them ... - ( BOOING ) We 've invited them along to the platform because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to London , we heard via a newspaper reporter that the employers had offered an interim bonus of ? 3 . But it 's not even a straightforward offer . It 's got all kind of clauses in it . One is a punctuality one . So that any illusion that it was ? 3 straight on top of your ? 13-8 , that 's completely false . ( @angry_shouting ) Now look , boys . We 've got nothing to hide . That 's why we 've invited , your committee have invited Brother Ogby , the National Officer , to come and explain to you his justification for the agreement . So I 'm asking you now , boys , give him as fair a hearing as you did me . All right , brothers ? - Brother Ogby . - MAN : Let 's hear what he 's got to say . MAN 2 : We do n't want it ! We just do n't want it . Thank you . Thank you , Eddie . Now , I know you men are in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing very short . I 'll just limit it to three points . Now the first thing is , I 'm Joe Ogby . I 'm the National Industrial Officer for your union , as Eddie just told you . Now , secondly , I consider that this agreement which I 've negotiated - on your behalf , is a good one . - MAN 3 : Rubbish ! ( CROWDSHOUTINGANGRILY ) I am convinced it is a good offer . ( @shouting_continues ) And I would advise you very strongly to grab it with both hands . ( SHOUTINGANDJEERING ) That ... That is the key to this . Now , you 've made your point . You 've made your protest . And you 've hit him where it hurts most . Now . All I 'm asking you to do is to allow me , on your behalf , to go back and make further negotiations with the employers . ( @angry_shouting ) I ca n't do that , I ca n't do that - unless you accept this offer . - ( @shouting_continues ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . ( CHANTING ) Off ! Off ! Off ! Off ! Your union has done as much as it can . Off ! Off ! Off ! Off ! - You ... - ( @chanting_continues ) All right , boys . All right , boys . All right , lads . I think that you 've answered the National Executive on the 3 quid . ( @crowd_cheering ) All right . Simmer down , then , lads . We 'll put it to a straight vote . Those in favour of the ? 3 offer , those in favour , show their hands . Those in favour , boys . I hope that the press are here - and take note of that . - They 'll be here . - Those against the ? 3 , brothers . - ( @all_cheering ) BOY : Do you know Ena Sharples ? ( @kids_laughing ) - ( ALLCLAMOURING ) - Come on . Come on , give him chance . I 'd just like to say one thing ... ( MENSHOUTINGANGRILY ) I 'd just like to say one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That this meeting today was in no way representative of the working force ... ( @angry_shouting ) Is in no way representative of the working force at Wilkinson . Why have you failed to get it put on the basic rate ? This is what we want to know . This is something that can be gone into at a future date , - but this is not the way to go about it . - ( @angry_shouting ) Are you worried about reports in the press about Communist infiltration in the strike ? - All right , yeah ? - CAMERAMAN : Yes , fine . REPORTER : All right ? All right ? Now , can I ask you if any of the members of the Communist Party are active in this strike ? - No , no chance . No . - ALL : No . No . Not at all . We all come to the meetings . Everybody turns up to the meetings . Everybody works for the company . They 're all workers of that company . And you 're on about outside infiltration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you so sensitive about that ? - The Communist Party ? Even if they are prepared to help us , why should n't they ? The CBI help their employees , do n't they ? Have you seen any evidence of outside infiltration ? No , we 've not . But do n't you feel left-wing militants are trying to wreck British industry by their strike actions ? All we want is a fare wage for a fair week 's work . Is anybody here a member of the Communist Party ? - No . We 're just workers . - MAN : Does it matter ? REPORTER : If you were a member of the Communist Party , - would you admit it to me on television ? - MAN : I would admit it if I was . - All right ? - Brothers . - Hello , boys . - All right , Mike ? Hello , Eddie . I had to come late . - It 's a card school going on in here . - Oh , aye ? - All right , lads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate ? - Who 's winning ? I won a bottle Champagne , the Queen Mary , and a night out on the town with Brigitte Bardot . - Have a fag , yeah ? - Oh , ta . - Have the cops bothered you at all ? - No . No , they was mooching round last night with the dogs and that , but they do n't know we 're here , like , you know . EDDIE : I saw plenty of lads here . - Well , plenty of lads here . - There 's a crowd of them , yeah . You know . You know , they change each day , sometimes they go up to the park if the weather 's all right , they do n't bother coming down here . EDDIE : Do you get scared down here , in case you get nabbed ? - Yeah . - Well , I think , um , Eddie , there 's something else I 'd like you to see . Just come this way , will you ? Okay , lads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jesus wept . What 's she doing here ? She 's been on strike a fortnight , no cash , thrown out of her digs , her and the kid . EDDIE : How long 's she been here ? She come in at about 9:00 tonight . She was crying her bloody eyes out . She 's from Geordieland . - And where 's the husband ? - She 's not married . Poor kid , eh ? What about the welfare , Sally Army , Social Security , somebody like that ? Yeah . I 'm in agreement with you . But that poor kid , she 's frightened in case they take the baby off her . She wo n't take no notice . You can tell her if you want , she thinks they 'll take the kid off her , so she wo n't go . She need n't stay there a minute longer . My missus will look after her and the baby . MAN : Hagan !

I mean , what have you come for ? I thought if there was owt I could do . John told me you were packing up and going round to your ma 's with the kids . Well , I 've got to , have n't I ? I ca n't stay here and let this happen again . I doubt if they 'll come back , though . I 'm not taking the chance . - You 'll be better off at your ma's . - I will . I 'm just about fed up .

How was it you kept clear of them ? Look , they got the taps on us all . It could have been Bert . It could have been Billy . It could have been meself . I 'm sick of the lot of it . You and all the other buggers , you got us into this mess . ( CRYING ) I hope when it 's all over that you steer clear of us . Never want to see you again . You want to get back to Russia , where you come from , where you belong . You and your communist ideas . Looks like you 've been reading the paper , Joan , like the rest . I 've known Les for , what , 11 years . I 've worked with him . I 've only met you the last couple of days . But Les has known me , what , 11 , 12 years . You 've got some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm had a hold on him . He 's not even the same husband he used to be . There 's 8,000 men have changed here . The 8,000 feel like Les but the 8,000 ... The 8000 's not in jail like Les . It 's 8,000 wage earners who are fighting for their rights . Oh ... Now , look . It 's no picnic . - I know what it 's all about ... - I 've got to consider the kids now . They 've got no father now . He 'll only be there a day or two . He 'll be out on bail . No father . No job . No nowt . No money . No love . Do you want a bit of a hand to pack your gear ? Could we get a taxi to take you and the kids round ? No . I 'll get the bus . I 'm asking no one for nothing . - Well , look , I 'll take you ... - I 've never asked you yet for anything and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take your case off you , could n't I ? - That 's going to be heavy . - I 'll carry it . - Come on .

Just leave me and my kids and get out of my life . All right , Joan . I 'll shove off now . I wo n't take the typewriter now . Would it be asking you too much to ask you for the key ? And I 'll come and get it . Get the paper . We need that . I do n't know what I 've done with it . I think he 's got it . I mean , we miss Les as much as we miss you , although he can only type with his two fingers . And we got to scout around now for someone that can do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , ' cause he 's done it long enough . And he 'll have nothing more to do with you when he comes out . He 's going to start learning to be a father again . You took that away from him with your rotten typewriter . Les is only learning now that he 's got to fight . He was n't interested in unions or anything till you came on the scene . You 've turned his head , he 's moody and he 's got no time for nobody but you . Your wife might like that kind of thing , but we do n't . They 'll do anything to drive us back to work , you know that , Joan . They 'll arrest a lot of us . It can go on for a long time , yes . They do n't give in that easy . That 's the test . If they can lose the profits or if we can tighten our belt more . That 's why we got to stick together .

" - And there 's a number here . - The same one that was in the other day . - What do you say we give him a tinkle ? - A lot of good that will do us . It 's worth a try , you know . TUC , the magic words . Probably might help us get a fair crack of the whip . Look , I told you . They 're all tarred with one brush . Maybe so , but we do n't lose anything by giving them a ring . - I do n't think so . - The strike 's going downhill , you know . Some of them are drifting back . Les is in the nick . Joey 's in there getting stitched up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll still get no help from the TUC . Yeah , but they 've made a move in the right direction - by putting this out . - I think so . - They 're showing a bit of interest . - Give us that number . I 'll ring them . Look , just be careful how you handle it . - What do you think I am ? Leave it to me . - Yeah , but be careful . ( TALKINGQUIETLY ) Oh . How is he , doctor ? Nothing very serious . Bruised his ribs . A few lacerations on his face and body . Not too much harm done . Hello ? Is that the TUC ? Well , I 'm one of the glass workers on strike and I 've just been reading your advert in the ...

Here you are , mate , taxi and everything . Steady on , steady on . They 've stuck about half a dozen needles up me arse . ( EXCLAIMINGINAGONY ) That 's a big help . ( EDDIESINGING ) Behave your bloody self . Hey ? With mates like you , I do n't need any bloody enemies . ( GROANING ) ( EDDIECONTINUESSINGING ) ( INAUDIBLE ) Well , before we discuss anything , lads , I think it 's fair to read the telegram from the TUC so that everything will be understood in the discussion . You know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I give you undertaking following the resumption of work . " Arrangements will be put in hand immediately " for you and strike committee representatives " to meet here , TUC headquarters " to thrash out all differences and difficulties that have arisen " with a view of ensuring this kind of situation will never occur again . Stop . " Statements made yesterday at the TUC General Purpose Committee . " Hope everybody concerned will give every assistance " in getting a resumption . " That 's the telegram , lads . Well , the way I see that , Eddie , is that we 've got no choice . You know , at least we 've got nothing to lose by going and talking to the guy . Look , I 'm not against talking to anybody . But I 'm definitely against going cap in hand to the TUC . All we 've got here is a message that they will convene a meeting once we get the men back to work . That 's all . Yeah , but I do n't see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just to anybody or another union . This is the Trade Union Congress . The Houses of Parliament that represent all unions . And I do n't think they 'd get us . I mean , they 're too big for that . I think you ca n't see the wood from the trees . If you read that telegram , " get you back to work " , " ensuring that this will never happen again " . That telegram was the very first steps to put the General Municipal back in the saddle with the authority over the men . How can you get any kind of support off the General Secretary of the TUC ? That will embarrass his sidekick , Hooper . BERT : Eddie , you 're talking like a defeatist . JERRY : Listen . Eddie 's right . The role of the TUC is broker for the government . Any government , Labour or Conservative . They 're there to break strikes . They 're there to nego ... To what they call negotiate an industry . To reach satisfactory agreements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , but let 's get this clear . I 've got implicit faith in the TUC , right . - Never mind bloody laughing . - EDDIE : Let the man have his say . And I firmly believe that wording in that telegram , " this sort of thing wo n't happen again " , I am taking that , I do n't know about you , but I 'm taking that as meaning that the bloody executive of the General Municipal Workers wo n't be able to cock us up again like they have this time . They wo n't have the bloody firm collecting the subscriptions that the unions use and things like this . - That 's how I see it . - Well , I agree with Mike . EDDIE : Well , Mike , can I ask you one question ? If there 's nothing categoric comes out of this , that there 's nothing signed that we know we 're going to get before we go to work , if we go to work only on the promises and we lead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for 1926 , what shall we do then ? Well , you 've had it . - Not as simple as that . - Let me qualify what defeatism means . The best strength that we 've got here , and after 100 and odd years , we 've got our strength here solidly out on strike . I believe that those are the men that can win the struggle . Could win it much quicker only if we can get help from other workers . I do regard that if we go to the TUC , that that will be the first step to defeat of this committee if we accept the things willy-nilly . ( @all_arguing ) If we do n't go down to see the TUC , they 'll go back and we could lose anyway . We lose the leadership . We lose the lot , do you know what I mean , Bert ? Now , I suggest this , as Frank says and agrees with me as well , that we lead the men back but we tell the men why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TUC but we may even come back and pull them out again if it 's not to our satisfaction . That 's what I think . And another thing that ... Well , I do n't suppose any of you have overlooked it , it 's all round us . The women and the kids are suffering . And all through the ages , this is how all strikes have been broken . This is how the bosses look at it , " Starve the bastards . " And it 's getting to that stage with us , you know . But you ca n't stop for halftime in a struggle like this . This is precisely what you 're saying , Bill . My head 's bloody killing me . I wish you could make some sort of a decision . JERRY : Okay , we 'll make one . Seven weeks ago , this strike started . Five weeks ago , we met with one thing in common and one thing only , ? 25 for a 40-hour week . EDDIE : That 's the ... Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had that one thing in common . And we found that it changed from just that struggle for that until we were taking on all-comers . Now , we have a responsibility to the rank and file . We can not shirk that responsibility . We are the leadership , and we 're immature and out of our depth and all that , but we are the only leadership they 've got . EDDIE : Now , the resolution you 're having put forward to you tonight , I was against it . The first time that this committee has been at loggerheads . But at the same time , I and the rest of the committee will abide by whatever you say and how you vote . That this meeting of the rank and file accept the terms laid down by the TUC and agrees to the strike committee 's recommendation for an immediate return to work ... - ( ALLPROTESTING ) - After which members of the committee will attend a special meeting at Congress House convened by the Trade Union Congress . That , brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold with that ! - Bloody promises ! We 're not going back on bloody promises , Eddie , after seven weeks . Get the brothers on strike ! ( @all_shouting ) EDDIE : All right , brothers . This meeting is democratic . Come and say your piece . ( @all_cheering ) ( ALLAPPLAUDING ) Promises , Eddie , we 're not going back on promises ! All right , brother , put it to the meeting , it 's democratic . I 'm all against going back on promises . ( @all_agreeing ) I vote that we kick this resolution into touch . - ( @all_agreeing ) - Where it belongs . And I move that we send this committee to London to get something in writing , and then we might go back , when we 've got something on paper . ( @all_cheering ) EDDIE : And there 'll be no return to work until that 's done . - ( @all_agreeing ) - All right , brothers . I declare the meeting closed , then , boys . You 've got to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything at once . ( @all_laughing ) Cor blimey . It 's a good job I 'm hungry . Oh , hey , that 'll be enough food now . I 'm going to the sanitations , John . - Just watch my money . - All right . - How 's the kids , Jerry ? - All right . ( INAUDIBLE ) What are you mooching round outside here for ? - I 'm in lumber , Eddie . - Lumber ? Why ? Trying to dodge the ticket collector . Blew the fare in on the gee-gees yesterday . Jesus Christ . You pillock . Well , that 's the way it goes . I 'm a bloody bonehead and stupid , I know . It 's engaged . But if you get caught , do n't drag us into it , you know . - No . - We got enough on our plates already . Tickets , please . That 's all right , sir . Put it under the door . ( @knocks_on_door ) Keep your hands off . We 're nearly there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( @men_chattering ) BILLY : It was the top brass of the TUC , our chief , in fact , you name it , they were all there . I was surprised at how smoothly it went . I mean , let 's face it . We were all a bit cagey . But I 've got to take me hat off to the big fellow . He lowered the temperature a bit and got things moving . He 's a gentleman , that bloke . He leaned over backwards , and I must say that without him I do n't think there 'd have been an agreement . As it was , we ended up with a document signed by himself , us and the General Secretary of the General and Municipal Workers . And this stated that there 'd be no victimisation . As far as we were concerned , that was it . I think even Eddie was satisfied . EDDIE : We went back on the understanding that there would be no victimisation . And in terms of pounds , shillings and pence , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . ( @all_chattering ) BILLY : If I live to be 100 , I 'll never forget that first day back . We knew as soon as we went in there 'd be trouble . You could smell it a mile off . The leaders , of course , they were singled out from the rest of us , Eddie in particular . Not satisfied with keeping him separated from everyone , they even had the foreman and production manager stood by as guards . No one was allowed to even approach him . And everywhere he went , they went . All that was missing was a number on his back . ( @machinery_whirring ) ( INAUDIBLE ) Well , we could n't swallow this , so we went back to the TUC . When I went back to work , they sent me to a school . Now , I 'd been on the job for seven years prior to this , right ? They sent me to school and put me on a job ? 7 less . I think the same thing has happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles with women for less money . And I think to Jerry . Now , I believe that they 're trying to promote some kind of action and bringing this about so that we possibly might cease work . And then other actions will follow . And we 've come here today to ask you what are you going to do about it ? TUC SECRETARY : Well , I 'm very sorry to hear this . But they told us there 'd be no victimisation and they 've flung everything at us bar the kitchen sink . We would n't have gone back otherwise . SECRETARY : The TUC ca n't intervene at all . All we can do is to advise . - Look , we do n't want bother . - Hmm . We 've been out seven weeks . We could have called a meeting this morning and had those lads out again . We took ' em back . We 've come down here on our own expenses for you to do something , to stop it blowing up . We do n't want bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something . Do n't tell us you 're here to advise . We want you to do something . Use your power as the head of the TUC . A word from you goes an awful long way . But are you prepared to do this ? You promised you would , you know . You did intervene , you know . You intervened to break the strike . You intervened and got us down here to a meeting where this document was signed . And you signed it along with us and the General Secretary of the Union . I 'll read it out to you and acquaint you with what it says . Paragraph A : " All the parties concerned agree " that there will be no victimisation of any individual " or any group of individuals , " and that every endeavour will be made " to remove present tension in the company . " Now , I 've told you that this exists . It 's been substantiated , or will be , by the lads round the table and I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension and help us get back in the spirit of the agreement that you signed ? SECRETARY : I signed that , well , as chairman of the meeting . In all good faith , I merely acted as an honest broker , you know , to bring both parties together . I 've got in touch with your union , invited them to come to the meeting . Where is he ? Where is the General Secretary of the Municipal General ? JOHN : He should be here by now , should n't he ? JERRY : If I may remind you , we 're asking for help before the bloody thing blows up . SECRETARY : Now , do n't try to tell me my job as well as you know yours . I 'm not telling you your job . I 'm asking you what you 're going to do . - ( @telephone_ringing ) - I 'm doing the best that I possibly can . JERRY : Well , it 's not good enough ! BILLY : It 's not good enough . SECRETARY : Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - ( **27;5774;TOOLONG ) - Shh . - SECRETARY : Oh . Oh , I see . Well , I 've got your lads here now at the moment . Ca n't they ? - Yeah , well ... - He should have been here for the start . SECRETARY : All right , I 'll give them your message . Well , I do n't suppose that you ... No . All right . Well , thanks very much for ringing . I 'm sorry , lads , but it 's off . ALL : What 's off ? - SECRETARY : The whole meeting . - Well , now it does smell . JERRY : Eddie , Eddie , Eddie ... ( @all_arguing ) - SECRETARY : It is off because ... - Cor blimey , I 'll explode . That was your General Secretary on the phone , advising you to go back to your jobs . Advising us ? Over the phone ? He should be here ! Because if the strike is over , there 's no point in pursuing it any further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing we can do . You have taken us to the cleaners , you have . You did n't know about this before we sat down , then ? - Of course I didn't . - You knew all about it , bloody liar . - SECRETARY : I did not know ! - I do n't believe one word of it . Listen , it 's very difficult for us to believe that a top man in the TUC had no knowledge that that phone call was going to come and that he would n't be here . What you 've done here is destroyed the whole faith of 8,000 men and this must be surely watched from other workers , dockers , car workers and so on . But I knew what was happening here , because that 's what your bureaucracy does . To get control of the struggle and lead it to defeat . It 's always the barrier between the worker and the boss . Well , you wo n't do it no more . Because you wo n't fool all the Trade Union Movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of people like you . Because you 're bloody traitors ! You 're Tories masquerading as socialists and leaders of the Trade Union Movement . And one day , we 'll sort the bleeding lot of yous out ! Those 8,000 men back there sent us down to see you because they had faith in the TUC . And when this comes out , every bloody trade union is going to want to know what you 're doing . I want to ask you one last question . We 've proved here that there 's victimisation . You 've agreed . Now , we know that it 's going to blow up further because your pal that 's just been on the phone wants the status quo and the control over the workers . Now , if when we go back and one of us is sacked , what 're you going to do about it ? Well , that 's a very hypothetical question . Do n't keep ramming the union down my throat ! They 're your union . Do n't keep ramming them down my throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter what you believe in . It does n't matter what you believe in . Look , the negotiating rights in this firm are taken up by the GMW . - Forget it . Forget it , mate . - FOREMAN : Have you got - an accredited shop steward or not ? - Forget it , mate . - Bugger the lot of you . - Right , you go ahead and go home . BILLY : This was the spark that set it off . Eric wanted the Rank and File Committee to represent him in his dispute with the foreman . The management , of course , refused point blank . And they 'd only recognise the old union . When this fellow insisted , he was suspended indefinitely . Then the balloon really went up . We held a meeting outside the factory and voted for a 3-day token strike . We wanted the right for the Rank and File Committee to represent the men on the shop floor . MAN : Ah , we never should have gone back in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-day strike in order to deal with us , the hardcore . Within hours of the vote being taken , we all received letters saying unless we went back , we 'd be sacked . Those who did go back were each given a yellow card . They had to show this before they were let in . But if you did n't have that card , then you were n't on , you were n't allowed in . ( @all_arguing ) You 're bloody well finished , mate . You 're finished . Joe , Joe , come on . Come on , we 'll only end up in bloody jail again . ( ARGUINGCONTINUES ) MAN : Come on out ! EDDIE : They also drew up two lists . A blacklist , which included names of fellows like meself , Billy , Frankie and Johnny and the rest . All , under no circumstances , would ever be employed again by the firm or any other firm locally , if it come to that . Also , the whitelist .

You 've been with the firm 4 3 years , I see . Yes , sir , I 'm going to retire next month . That 's a long time . Well , look , Charlie , I 'm awfully sorry about this , but in line with company policy , I can offer you reemployment , but not reinstatement . How do you mean by that ? How do you mean by that , like ? Well , it boils down to this . That we can set you on , but it 'll be as a new starter and that means you lose all your pension rights and so on . No pension after 4 3 years , sir ? I 'm afraid so , yes . This is company policy and I 'm bound by it . So it means that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if we start you again ? CHARLIE : Hmm . Well , you would go on strike , would n't you ? Well , I had to follow the boys , did n't I ? You see , if I did n't go out , they 'd all call me black leg or summat like that . I just followed them out , like the silly old fool I was . Yes , if you 'd taken the advice of the company letter , you would n't have been in this position now , would you ? No , sir . - I suppose you regret it . - Yes . Well , I 'm terribly sorry , Charlie , but there 's nothing else I can do . I can offer you a job here , but as a new starter and it is n't reinstatement . I suppose I 'll have to take it ' cause I ca n't get a job anywhere now at my age , can I ? No . Well , then , we 'll leave it at that , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at the firm the next shift . - Right . - Good . Thank you , sir . EDDIE : The Industrial Relations Bill is being introduced to help curb the activity on the shop floor . Now , this bill is designed to prevent any worker going through the kind of struggle that we went through . Once there had been one move , they would have said , " Your agreements have been signed as sacrosanct . " Undertakings have been given that there 'll be no rank and file action . " If we had 've come out then , meself , the committee would have ended up inside , because we could n't have paid any fines . I think that we 're already treading the same ground as the German worker did under Hitler and Mussolini 's Italy . I mean , this is the first step . Surely to God we 've seen the futility of rank and file-ism , that blind militancy will get us nowhere . The only question is one of political leadership and a foundation or the founding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , the cry of a kiddie , the hungry kiddie , that means much more to me than all the laws and all the prisons in creation . I go along with Trotsky , that life is beautiful . Let the future generation cleanse it of all the oppression , violence and evil and enjoy it to the full .

How did you find him ? Pure chance as in all such cases . The medical report on the hand abnormality at birth found its way to me . I have a complete record of your life since then . Why is our son malformed ? I beg your pardon ? Why is our son malformed ? You must be aware of something as elementary as the De Vries theory .

Of course , we 'll be back numbers , you and I . But at least there wo n't be the danger of the world being blown up . There will be a future . This new strain must have every chance . That 's why I need your son . - Will you co-operate ? - How ? I need you to persuade him to enter my establishment . - He 'll be well looked after . - A laboratory ?

There 's only one chance for [Charles] to survive and that in my laboratory . I want to see what sort of man he 'll make . I want him to live that long . Smoke Oakleaf .

I am so tired of it all . [door_opens] [Boy] It was a success . There are some sandwiches in the kitchen . As soon as you 've had eaten , we 're leaving . Leaving ?

You understand everything , do n't you , Mother ? Except me . Oh , please . She understands me . She accepts me ... even my hands . I 'm not something peculiar . Who said you were ? To her , I 'm not something that has to be looked after in case I make a mistake . I 'm a real person . [Charles] , will you help me with the bags ? Yes , this one ? I come to life when I 'm with her . - I 'm not leaving . - You ca n't throw your life away - just for some ... - I 'll take the risk . Now , look . You 've got to trust us , [Charles] .

There 's someone who can advise you better than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do . President Logan is requesting you run the effort to recover the stolen weapon and be in place to make whatever decisions need to be made . - Is it compatible ? - I 'll need to reconfigure the trigger . - Has the warhead been reconfigured ? - Yes . - We may have a potential security breach . - Who ? The technician , Sabir . His girlfriend 's getting suspicious . I think Sabir may have become involved with radical groups . - You mean terrorists ? - Yes . The woman who was suspicious about her boyfriend panned out . She sent us a schematic of a microchip . It 's used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads . Take a team with you . Let 's go . What was that ? He 's gon na ram us ! - Good to have you back , Mr President . - Than you , Aaron . - This way , sir . - President Logan 's not in the West Wing ? No , sir . Since the strike on Air Force One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your son ? - Very well , sir . Thank you for asking . - Still in the service ? - Yes . In fact , he just re-upped . - Good for him . - I 'm mighty proud . Mr President . Thank you for coming . - Is there an update on President Keeler ? - No , he 's still comatose . - The long-term prognosis is still unclear ? - Yes . - How 's President Logan ? - Looking forward to seeing you . Thank you , Eric . President Logan . David . I appreciate your coming so quickly . Tell me how I can help you . David , I was n't prepared to have all of this thrust upon me so suddenly . What I 'm trying to say is , I made mistakes . This crisis could have ended an hour ago if I had n't interfered with the CTU operation that would have captured Habib Marwan . Punishing yourself is something you ca n't afford now . What I ca n't afford and what this country ca n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans . - I understand the pressure you 're under . - I know you do . In office , you dealt with this kind of situation more than once . That 's why I want you here . I still do n't understand what it is I can do to help you . Sit . The warhead that was stolen is an S-series . That 's one of the most powerful nuclear weapons in the arsenal . Wherever it 's detonated , it will wreak unthinkable devastation . Help me find it . I 'll give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it 's necessary . Charles , how do you want this to work ? I 'll call Bill Buchanan at CTU , and I 'll let him know that he 'll be dealing directly with you . All right . Thank you , David . Mike will fill you in . We will get through this , Mr President . Um , I 'll be , uh , in conference room B , working on the morning statement for the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Thank you , Mike . Mr President . I know you believe my actions during your term in office amounted to a personal and political betrayal . That 's not something I believe . It 's a fact . Get to your point . If my presence here makes it more difficult for you , say the word and I 'll leave . Mike , you 're wired into this administration . And I have no doubt that you have this country 's best interests at heart . So for now , let 's let bygones be bygones and get to work . Thank you , Mr President . I appreciate that . I reviewed the briefing on the way here . Have army reserves supplement the search teams looking for the warhead in Iowa . And have DOE and DOD coordinating on crisis response - in case it 's detonated . - Yes , sir . CTU is heading up the search for this man who stole the warhead , Habib Marwan ? Yes , they recovered a damaged video tape from Marwan 's last known location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Marwan is not CTU 's only lead on the warhead now . - What else do they have ? - A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian secured a hard drive belonging to one of Marwan 's associates . This hard drive may contain information that could lead us to the warhead . I told you , I 'm not hurt . I did the shooting . Now please leave me alone so I can do this . The hard drive is unlocked . It belonged to someone who had no experience of nuclear weapons . - He got that information from someone . - The emails I 'm decrypting look like that . Schematics , designs of triggers , - all from the same person . - Who ? The address is shielded under a false domain name . - What is it ? - MEM4FT . - Forward the emails to us . Edgar ? - I 'll run a trace to find a point of origin . These emails came from a domestic server . Whoever sent this is in this country . OK , Chloe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you holding up ? I 'm not used to the idea that I just killed someone , but I 'm doing my job . Fair enough . Get back as soon as you can , OK ? OK . I got a hit . The man who sent the emails . Name is Lee Jong . - Is he in our database ? - Chinese national . A researcher at China 's nuclear weapons programme . He was accused of falsifying research data and fired in 2001 . Is China providing Marwan with support for this ? They would n't use someone that could be traced to them . He 's selling his services as a freelancer . If he 's helping Marwan reconfigure the warhead , he 'll know how to find him . See if Lee entered the country last week . Excuse me . This is Bauer . Jack ? Dr Besson . You wanted me to give you an update on Paul Raines . He 's still in recovery , but you can see him now . Just a few minutes . Thank you . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I find you ? - I 'll be in Medical . Hey . Dr Besson wants to move you to Amherst General , but the FAA still has a ban on air travel . I am trying to get you an exemption . Well , if anyone can get an exemption , you can . Listen . I 've thought a lot about this , and I want to go with you to Massachusetts . - With me ? - Yeah . You need to get better , and you should n't have to do that alone . I can take care of myself . I do n't need your charity . It 's not about charity , Paul , it 's what I want to do . What about Jack ? You said you were in love with him . I know . Sorry , I did n't mean to interrupt . - I 'll come back later . No , it 's all right . Come in . I thought you 'd be at the DOD briefing . - Yeah , it ended early . - Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been trying to get down here since you got out of surgery . - Listen , Paul ... - You do n't have to say anything . Yeah , I do . You saved my life . I was in the wrong place at the wrong time . That 's all . - You pushed me out of the way . - Honestly , I was n't even thinking . It just happened . Paul . You all right ? I 'll check back on you later . Does he know that you want to come with me ? Not yet . - What is it ? - We found Lee Jong . Chinese consulate . He must have known we were coming . He took refuge . He got there an hour ago . Consulate 's sovereign territory , we ca n't get him . But we 're gon na try . David Palmer for you . David Palmer ? Frankly , Logan 's been overwhelmed by what 's happening . - He enlisted Palmer to help us directly . - Good . - Bauer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , Mike . - It 's nice to talk to you again , Jack . - It 's nice to talk to you too . I assume Bill told you about Lee Jong ? Yes , sir . I 'm about to call the Chinese consul and explain the situation . I 'd like it if you took Lee into custody and brought him to CTU for interrogation . - You think the consul will cooperate ? - He 's reasonable . And if the protocol approach does n't work ? I 'll leave it to you to make the preparations . Whatever it takes . We need this man Lee in custody . - I understand , Mr President . - Thank you , Jack . - You have a Chinese interpreter ? - Melissa Raab . I need her , Curtis and one of his agents ready to move on the consulate . Edgar Stiles . - We got a partial . - I 'm opening a window . Send it through . Ms Dessler . Division called . That video tape , they were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my workstation as we speak . Bill . People of America , you wake up today to a different world . One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you . It 'll be days and weeks before you can measure the damage we have caused , but as you count your dead ... " Wake up today to a different world . " Do we take that literally ? He 'll set off the warhead before dawn ? We have to look at the worst case scenario . What time is sunrise on the east coast ? 7:02 . Less than two hours from now . Unless you renounce your policies of imperialism and interventionist activities , this attack will be followed by another , and another after that . The Chinese consul in Los Angeles . A man named Koo Yin . Mr Koo . This is David Palmer . It 's an honour to speak with you . I 'm calling on behalf of President Logan . The situation today has forced him to direct his attention to other equally urgent matters . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible attacks on your country . We stand ready to help in any way we can . Thank you . The fact is , you can help us . There 's a man in your consulate by the name of Lee Jong . Yes . He arrived here earlier tonight . We have evidence connecting him to the terrorists behind today 's attacks . We need to take Mr Lee into custody immediately for questioning . Mr Lee expected suspicion to fall on him . He says he has no connection to terrorists . We believe he 's helping terrorists detonate a nuclear device on our soil . Many lives are at stake , Mr Koo . President Palmer , I would very much like to help , but Mr Lee is a Chinese citizen , and the consulate is Chinese territory . I ca n't hand him over to you without going through channels . Then I urge you to contact the premier immediately and explain the situation . Tell him speed is of the essence . Tell him cooperation will be regarded as an extraordinary act of friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will respond in kind . Mr President , I 'll do my best . I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . Thank you , Mr Koo . Consul 's gon na try to make something happen . How long will it take ? I do n't know . Anything new ? White House authorised adding Iowa army reserve units to the ground search . - Have they widened the perimeter ? - 60-mile radius around the area . But Marwan 's people might have sneaked it outside that . We closed all major roads and air traffic , but there is a chance they got it through . Homeland Security 's faxing over casualty projections based on that . - That 's probably them right now . - Yeah . I 'll get it . - CTU . - I 'm calling for Tony . Who 's this ? Michelle Dessler , a colleague . Who 's calling ? The woman he happens to be living with . Is he there ? Yeah . Hold on . - It 's for you . - Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jen . I 've been calling everyone , going crazy looking for you . Then I thought maybe Jack took you back there . Do you have any idea how worried I 've been ? I 'm sorry , I should have called , but I 've been busy . Oh , really busy with Michelle Dessler ? - I 'm working , Jen . - For CTU ? On a provisional basis , yeah . I thought you hated that place . Things have changed a little . Yeah . I guess they have . We can talk about this later . Right now I got ta go . - Tony , what 's your ex-wife doing there ? - Jen , I 'm sorry , but I got ta go . Michelle , um ... I 'm sorry you had to find out like that . It 's really none of my business . Yeah , it is . I should have told you I was living with somebody . - I do n't want to talk about this right now . - Yeah , well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything fell apart . Jen happened to be there for me . You do n't have to excuse your relationship . I 'm not making excuses . I 'm just telling you how it is . Do you love her ? No . Ms Dessler , new protocols from DOD came in . Should I send them to your screen ? Send them to station 16 . Thank you , Edgar . - You OK ? - I 'm fine . Is there anything I can do ? I said I 'm fine . I 'm trying not to think about what happened . I 'm gon na process it later . Sure , fine . Edgar , I appreciate your concern , I really do . It 's just that when I shot that guy I thought I 'd go all foetal , but I did n't feel anything at all . I hope I 'm not some kind of a psychopath . - He was trying to kill you . - But still ... Maybe it 's a delayed reaction kind of thing . Maybe you 'll freak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . - Anything you come up with ... - Sir . Sir . Bill Buchanan . - Thank you . - All right . - Yes , Bill . - Mr President . We 've seen a tape recorded by Habib Marwan . On it he says we 'll be " waking up to a different world " . It may indicate that the warhead will be detonated before dawn on the east coast . Thank you , Bill . CTU thinks that the warhead may be detonated before dawn . Get me Mr Koo . - This is Koo Yin . - Please hold for President Palmer . We have the consul , sir . - Mr Koo . - I did n't expect to hear from you so soon . Is the premier aware of the situation ? - Yes , he 's considering it very carefully . - There 's no time for that . I 've learned the terrorists may detonate a nuclear device within the next two hours . I understand the urgency of the situation . Without making any promises , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I 'll speak with him in two to three hours . - I told you , that 's not soon enough . - I 'm sorry , Mr President , it 's the best I can do . Thank you for your efforts . Please keep me informed . Of course , Mr President . He thinks Mr Lee will be handed over to us , but not before two or three hours . From their point of view , that 's very fast for something like this . From ours , not nearly fast enough . What do we do ? - Bauer . - Jack , are you at the consulate yet ? Yes , sir . We 're across the street . Have they agreed to release Lee ? Not quickly enough . And I just learned that the nuclear device may be set off at any moment . Now , Jack . Is there any doubt in your mind that Lee is working with Marwan ? No , sir . The emails he sent left no room for doubt . Then we have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this . Ever . If you 're caught , you 'll be tried in a Chinese court under Chinese law . I understand . Now , Jack , if it was anyone else , I 'd ask if you were sure about this . With you I already know the answer . God bless you . Good luck . Thank you , Mr President . We 're on . We 're going in to get him . All right . - Almeida . - Tony , this is Jack . I 'm at the consulate . I need infrared satellite coverage . I 'm on it . What 's going on , Jack ? The consul 's not gon na release Lee in time . We have to go in and get him . - Who knows ? - We 've authorisation from the White House . Tony , this is a covert operation . You 're the only person in CTU who can know . Spoof the satellite logs and make sure the mainframes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any record . You understand ? - Yeah . - OK , thanks . Let 's suit up . - Tony , it 's Jack . I 'm on comm . - I 'm uploading a picture of Lee to you now . Also , I just got ahold of the building schematic . - You overlay the infrared ? - Coming now . The bulk of them are in the first floor residential area . - Most of ' em not moving . Probably asleep . - Try the second floor offices . All right . Grabbing data on the second floor . - All right , we got people moving . - That third room is probably where Lee is . - I think you 're right . - I 'll get back to you as soon as I 'm moving . - How do you want to deploy ? - I want Agent Raab to stay in the van . You cover the perimeter . I go in alone . - Jack . - My orders are to make this deniable . If I get caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting alone . - All right . What do you want us to do ? - Cover the perimeter . You can re-engage as soon as I leave the consulate . But only on a covert basis . Masks on , non-lethal force . You understand ? We 'll be here . - I 'm going in . Any change on infrared ? - Negative . We 'll monitor in real time . The alarm system 's a Cambria model three . I 'm jumping the release of the door now . Roger that . All right , Jack , stop . We have somebody approaching from your west side , I repeat , your west side . OK , he'smovingaway . Gim me the status on the other guards . Jack , you 're right on top of ' em . We have someone approaching from your north side . OK , you 're clear . - I got him . - Roger that . People moving towards you on both floors . Exiting the consulate . Hostiles in pursuit . Bring up the van now . Go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . He 's been hit . Pass me a medical bag . Now ! - We 're in . - Go , go ! - Jack , give me your status . - We 're away , Lee 's in custody . - He 's shot in the back . No exit wound . - How bad is it ? Ca n't tell . Does n't look too severe . We 're on our way . - We 're about 15 minutes out . - All right , I 'll have Medical ready . - He does n't want you to touch him . - Tell him I need to check his wound . Hold him down . Hold him down , now ! You need to calm him down so I can talk to him . Medical assistance is waiting and this will ease the pain . - Does he understand ? - Yes . That 's great . Thank you very much . Hey . The FAA 's cleared us to leave at eight o'clock on a medical transport plane . - Dr Besson 's agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as you settle in I 'll start looking for an apartment . I do n't know what to say . - I 'm gon na get through this . - I know you will . Raines . **26;1361;TOOLONG . A medevac will be there to pick you up at 0630 . - You 're gon na take care of the transportation . - Yes , ma'am , that 's correct ... I got ta call you back . Paul ? Paul , what is it ? Paul ? Dr Besson ! Please , someone come quickly ! OK , OK , OK . It 's OK , he 's right here . Ten milligrams vasopressin . He just started gasping , I do n't know what 's going on . I can barely hear his heart . - All signs point to a cardiac tamponade . - What does that mean ? The sac round his heart is filling with blood . We can drain it , we got ta get him to surgery . If we do n't stop the bleeding , his heart will not function . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray now . I need to roll him on his back . There . Tell him we know he helped Marwan with the warhead , and we need him to help us find Marwan before he can detonate it . If he denies it , tell him we can prove it . He does n't deny it . He knows where Marwan is , he 'll tell you if you agree to terms . What are they ? He was seeking protection from our government as well as Marwan . Marwan wants to kill him to prevent him from talking . He wants our guarantee of protection . Tell him if the information leads us to the warhead in time , he will be immune from prosecution and I will take him wherever he wants to go . He wants a guarantee of this in writing from the president . Tell him I understand that and I give him my word . But I need the information now . He says guarantee first . That 's not good enough . One minute . This is ... This is Bauer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him through . Jack , Buchanan told me you 've got Lee Jong in custody , and that he was wounded . - Yes , sir . - Is he talking ? He wo n't until he has a written guarantee he wo n't be prosecuted . We also have to provide safe travel . His guarantee has to be signed by the president . Jack , CTU believes the detonation of this warhead is imminent . - Can you force him to talk immediately ? - I do n't think so . I think the fastest way to make this happen is to give him what he wants . OK . I 'll get the guarantee from Logan and have it waiting at CTU . Thank you , sir . - What is it ? - Su Ming , the deputy Chinese consul . - They did n't waste any time . - They have to know we 're behind the attacks . What should I tell them ? I 'll take the call . We have to start fencing with them sooner or later . Might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a guarantee of immunity and safe transport . Get that from Logan , will you ? - Mr Su . - Yes . - Is this President Palmer ? - Yes . Has the premier responded to the consul 's request to have Mr Lee turned over ? Mr President . The consul is dead . - What ? - He was shot , when armed men broke into this building and took Mr Lee with them by force . I am shocked and deeply saddened . Please convey that to your government on behalf of mine . Mr President . Is it your position that you have no knowledge of this operation ? That the timing of your call and this abduction is entirely coincidental ? The consulate is sovereign territory of the People 's Republic of China . I ca n't believe anyone connected with this country had a hand in it . I 'm sure you understand the political ramifications if you are incorrect . I 'm sure you understand the ramifications of unproven accusations . No accusations have been made , Mr President . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your government will have my complete cooperation . Thank you , Mr President . I 'm sure you 'll be hearing from us again . Very soon . President Logan will provide Lee with a written guarantee , as long as it remains covert . Sir ? What 's wrong ? Koo Yin was killed in the course of the abduction . My God ! By one of our own people ? No . It must have been friendly fire , but it really does n't matter . If they 're able to find proof that we were involved , in the long run the repercussions will be as serious as those we face with the terrorists . Tony . I just heard that Lee Jong is on his way here and he 's been shot . How did this happen ? The Chinese were n't gon na give Lee up in time , so Jack had to extract him . Jack went into the consulate ? On whose authority ? The White House . Why is this the first I 'm hearing about this ? This needed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - But you knew about it . - Yes , I did . I ran tactical from here . It is absolutely unacceptable I was kept out of the loop on this . - That 's the way Jack wanted to play it . - You do n't work for Jack ! You work for me . A situation , frankly , I wish I 'd been consulted on in the first place . - Meaning ? - It was a mistake to reinstate you . Now I 'm certain of it . Look , I understand you do n't appreciate being kept in the dark , but I think this is about something else . Well , you 're wrong about that too . And you were way out of line ! OK , thank you . Tell him we 're almost there . The medical assistance and the guarantee are waiting for him . - - - I ca n't understand him . - Ask him if he 's in pain . He says he 's cold , very cold . What 's going on , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs are full of fluid . - I 'll alert CTU . Mr Lee . Mr Lee . Tell me where Habib Marwan is . Please , tell me where he is now . Dammit , we 're losing him . All right , stand by with the gurney . We 're coming in hot . Jack . Jack , what 's going on ? - Jack ? You ca n't come in here . - He 's dying ! - So 's he . Get out , I just started this . This is our only connection to a stolen warhead . Save him . - I 'll get to him . - He wo n't make it . - I already have a patient ! - Curtis . - You have a new one . - Are you crazy ? This is the only man who can find the missing warhead and stop it being detonated . If you do n't save him , millions will die . Do you understand ? Millions of people . Start working on him now ! - Jack , what are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , he 'll die . - You do n't know that for sure . - Jack ! Do it . Now ! - More volume . - Yes , doctor . Jack , please . Please do n't do this . His lungs are damaged . He 's lost a lot of blood . Stabilise him so I can talk to him . Can you do that ? - Maybe . Beborah , I need you over here . - What about Mr Raines ? Chest compressions if his pressure drops . I got it . - Put some gloves on . Jack . Jack ! I have my orders . I 'm doing my job . - I 'm sorry . - Sorry ? You 're letting him die ! - Get her away from me now . - Stop it , Jack ! Jack , stop ! He saved our lives . He has a tension pneumo , we have to relieve the pressure immediately . Let go of me ! Jack , listen to me . Please , stop this . Jack , please , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! OK , let go of me . Please ! Jack , Paul 's crashing . Starting CPR . What can we do for him ? What can we do for him ? He 's in V-fib . Use the defibrillator . Charging . Come on , buddy . Clear . - Come on . Hit him again , Jack . Charging . Clear . - He 's still flatlining . - Give him epinephrine . - Where is it ? - It 's on the tray , second syringe on the left . Got it . Inject it in the IV . It 's in . - Come on , please , Paul . Jack . Jack . He 's dead . - Jack ... - No . - Jack ! - No ! He 's gone . Oh , my God . You son of a bitch , Jack , you son of a bitch ! You killed him ! He saved your life . - Get her out of here now . - How could you ? You killed him ! I hate you , Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You killed him , Jack . You killed him ! Paul ... Let go of me !

My transfer 's not holding . I 'm growing hair , and my armpits smell , and there 's a constant circus in my pants . Aw , our old man is becoming a boy . No , no I 'm serious . The seal 's broken , and I 'm losing oil . Look at this . ooh ! What is it ? It 's a nipple . What am I going to do about it ? - I do n't know , but until we figure it out , maybe you should sleep in the shower . Gentlemen , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Dr . Solomon , would you care to share with us some of Dr . Albright 's feelings ? - Oh , yes , of course . Well , first , on behalf of Dr . Albright , I would like to say welcome to this big waste of time . I 'd say I 've always wanted to put a face with those men whom she affectionately calls " the night of the teaching dead " . And may I say you do not disappoint . I can tell at a glance that you indeed are a mindless and dull group . So , I would like to start with a fresh idea that you wo n't recognise when it bites you on the ass . Excuse me , does Dr . Albright know you 're speaking on her behalf ? Do n't move ! Stay where you are ! Dr . Solomon .. - Freeze ! He 's still there ! Oh ! You have a mole . A big , ugly mole . Well , you 're in early . Dr . Byron told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rest assured , I gave you full credit . What the hell are you trying to do ? Ruin me ? It will take me weeks to repair the damage left in your wake . Weeks . All you had to do was show up and feign interest . Feign ? I will not be a party to feigning . I always tell the complete truth . The truth ? Then I will be brutally Frank . Good , I 'll be genuine Dick . I thought , foolishly , this would be a good opportunity for my colleagues to get to know you . No one wanted to meet you . I made that up . So you lied ? I was bending the truth to flatter you . There 's a difference . Oh I see . So when we met , you said you were pleased to meet me . Was that a lie or " truth-bending " ? - " Figure of speech " . And when you said you were impressed with my r ? sum ? ? - " Light conversation " . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing your office ? " Diplomacy " . Anything else ? Yes , is that really the color of your hair ? - Absolutely ! You 're upset , are n't you ? Tell the truth . - Yes . I thought I could trust you . I ca n't . Trust me ? You 're the one who lied and tricked me . No . It 's not how you lie to trick someone . First , you start by .. you have something on your tie . Ah-ha , very clever . Yes , I see how that works . You have something on your shoulder . That 's not how it works . This is how it works . Your shirt tail 's on fire . That 's how . Your blouse is on fire . Stop .. get your hands off me ! Do n't move ! Whyyy ! That was my fly . I know . On the subject of universal truth , Albert Einstein once said .. any thoughts on that ? Anyone ? Yes , Caryn . Dr . Solomon , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einstein spoke German . Okay , I 'll simplify . " Scientific proof is nothing more than conditional truth " . We all understand what truth is , do n't we ? Now , I have three of Einstein 's equations on the board . Two of them are false , and one is true . Who can spot the true one ? Anyone ? How many of you think it 's number one ? I 'll give you a hint : it 's not number one . Here 's another hint : it 's not number two . How many of you think it 's number three ? Well , you 're wrong . I lied . I made them all up ! You see , lying accomplishes nothing . You ca n't trust someone who lies . You work with them . You think you know them . They ask you to substitute . You make a fool of yourself . They get mad . And your sister ca n't even get a driver 's licence . Dr . Solomon , is this going to be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell the absolute truth , or else you just end up confusing people . But , Dr . Solomon , sometimes you just ca n't tell the truth . But why not ? Anyone ? Leon , I 'm going to ask you a question , and I want you to tell me the complete truth . This wo n't affect my grade ? Absolutely not . What do you think of me ? Uh ... you make me really nervous . I do n't know what 's going on half the time , and when you walk around the room , I 'm always afraid you 're going to hit me in the back of the head . Thank you . There , you see ... the truth . By the way , Leon , you 're failing . I thought you said it would n't affect my grade . It did n't . Anybody home ? Anyb-- Oh , hi . I brought you folks your extra key . Yeah , right . Good excuse .

Come back in three weeks . I ca n't come back . I ca n't . Sorry , those are the rules . - I need a licence now . I 'm the woman . I really need your help . You must be a genius . Your line is so big , but it moves so fast . Well , I do my best . There 's got to be some way you can help me . I mean , I know you have a heart in that .. big , hairy , wonderful chest of yours . I bet pretty girls beg you all the time , huh ? Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get very good at this . Hey , what did you put under " weight " ? Tommy , are you all right ? Where have you been ? The mall , Dick . I was at the mall . It may be the most emotionally satisfying place I 've ever been . Were you able to observe other life-forms ? Definitely . Everybody there was as oily and disgusting as me . It was a food court of mutants , a catalog of horrors , a freak show , and I was their lizard king . Oh . What do you do when you 're there ? Hang . - What do you see ? Stuff . I belong now . Oh , yeah , stay out of my room ! Dick ? Dick , look , I got my driver 's licence . According to this , you 're a 55-year-old , 300-pound Asian woman . And an organ donor . Dick , I got my driver 's permit , too . Yes , I expected you would .

Or shall I confess that your boyish good looks are stunted only by your personal bigness ? Oh , where to begin simply exhausts my feminine mind . What are you doing ? - Lying . You like it ? - It 's incredible . I love it ! - Really ? Yes ! How did you do it ? - Anybody can do it . Look at me , I 've just done it once , and here I am , whipping it out there .

You really should have that thing removed . It 's all I can look at . Excuse me . - I - - looks like there 's just the two of us . I 'll have a pitcher of that stuff . May I see your driver 's license ? - You bet you can . Okay , Mrs . Wu . I discovered something today , and I really need to try it out . Thorazine . I 'll get you some water .

You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks are like ... a beer tap , a golden rush of drunken beauty with a nice head which spills all down your blouse , leaving you sweet and pungent . That was pathetic . Well , I 'm sorry I 'm not as good a liar as you are . Well , I 'm sorry . I 'm leaving . Wait ! You 're not finished with me yet ! Do you mind ? We 're talking . Okay , you win . What is it ? - I 've realized something . I ca n't lie to you . I wish I could . It 's just not something that I 'm good at , like .. like ... actually , I 'm good at everything . Can I tell you the truth ? - Why not ? The real truth is , you 're delightful . I love looking into your face .

May I walk you home ? And be honest . Okay . You know , if someone had told me a year ago that I 'd be driving a car and sucking the flesh off a dead bird , I 'd have called ' em a liar . Being human is far more complex than I thought . There is no absolute personal truth here , and these bodies do n't come with an owner 's manual . So every day these people have to make up life , and truth becomes highly individual . Oh , my god , Dick , what if this lying thing falls into the hands of the politicians ? Ooh , that 's a horrifying thought . I think these humans bend the truth because this is a difficult place to live . It 's a lonely blue dot on the far end of the galaxy . And all the half-truths and flattery and diplomacy are the lubricant that people spread on each other to get over the rough spots .

He , he went through rehab , has n't had a drink in three years . He 's an artist . He just got this job teaching at a small college . It does n't pay much , but he 's managed to save enough money to give me the child support due to Peter since the time he left . He wants a second chance . What do you want ? I want to go back in time and never return his phone call . I wan na , I wan na take back that cup of coffee and the conversation . Given that that 's not gon na happen , what do you really want ? I want Vic ... ( sighs ) to be somebody other than Vic . He 's still the same irresponsible , annoying , angry guy he always was . I thought it was the alcohol , turns out it 's him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm judging him too harshly .

Chandler seems to be getting very close to Peter . Are you and Chandler considering ... marriage ? No , no . And even if we were , this , this turn of events would mean reconsidering . Not that Chandler 's not a great guy , he is . He 's the best thing that 's happened to me and Peter in years ... Did I just hear my name mentioned ? I missed you . I missed you , too .

Hi . I just wanted to say good night . Oh , that 's very nice of you . Good night . I love you . I love you , too . That 's why I 'm hoping you can find out what 's going on with Peter . He sounded really angry on the phone tonight . And he practically hung up on me after making me promise to call him after I was finished my homework . I know you met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling sessions are private matters that I do n't share . Oh . So it was a counseling session , not just , say , a friendly meeting . Good night . Fine . Good night . I just hope that Paris did n't say no to Chandler . I hope that 's not what 's making Peter angry . No to Chandler ? Good night . What 's up ? I hate my mother . Eh , we all probably hate our mothers at one time or another . Restrict you ? No . Took away something ? No . Wo n't let you buy something ? No . Does n't want you to play some sport because it 's too dangerous ? Uh-uh . Made you eat something that 's good for you that you do n't like ? Made you wear bad pants ?

How do you feel about that ? How do I feel ? If I had wanted to talk to a shrink , I would have gone to one . I wanted to talk to a man . How would you feel if you were put in my position ? I do n't want to see my dad . I do n't want to talk to him ... I wish he were dead . You know , my father is dead , and I ca n't tell you how much I miss him . Maybe I 'm not the right person to talk to after all . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to offend you , but my father was a drunk , a mean drunk , and he left us , and my mom 's worked really hard to get us what we have now . And we 're happy , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dad 's shown up and ruined everything . Marry Chandler ? Well , he has n't asked her yet , but he asked me , and I said yes . But now that is n't going to happen . Now everything is ruined . Now everything is more complicated , but maybe it 's not ruined . What is your mom asking you to do ? Just see your dad ? Just talk to him ? One or the other . It sounds like you 're really angry with him . Maybe this is an opportunity to tell him how angry you are . I 'm not going to forgive him , and I 'm not going to forget what he did . Are n't you the guy who recently helped facilitate a meeting between an alcoholic father and his son ? What 's the difference between what your mom is asking you to do and what you asked that father and son to do ? I 'll tell you . That was them and this is me . I liked that father , he was nice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like my father , and he really is n't nice at all . Trust me . It 's going to be okay , Peter . Everything is going to be okay . You can do this . And if you ca n't do it alone , Reverend Camden will go with you , or your mom will go with you . Or even both of them . Would you ? Sure . But why me ? Because if Reverend Camden or my mom go with me , I 'll have to be a good little boy ; but if you go with me , I can say what I really want to say . You 're a cop , you know the dark side of life . Does Chandler know about this ? Oh , yeah , he and my mom are fighting about it right now . You did what ? I would n't have asked him that if I had known that you were having coffee with your ex with the dream of getting back together with him . Getting back together with my ex-husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did you meet with him ? Because he 's Peter 's father and he asked me to meet with him . Would you get back together with him simply because he 's Peter 's father ? There 's nothing simple about it . And if you were serious about me , about Peter and me , about us , then why would n't you tell me before you told Peter ? Would it have made any difference ? Please , please , please . I ca n't say anything . Did Peter tell you not to say anything ? No , but he obviously does n't want you to know or he would have talked to you . Okay , you 're right . And I 'm sorry , I should n't have even asked . Thanks . You want a cookie ? I feel like a cookie . I do feel like a cookie and a big glass of milk . We have cookies . We do n't have milk . I 'll walk over and get some . It 's cold out . I 'll go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got home . Where were you ? At your house . Why did n't you come up to see me ? I went to see Kevin . I just called to apologize about before . I got some stuff going on . It 's about that business trip your mom went on , is n't it ? I might as well tell you . She saw my dad . What 's the big emergency ? It 's not an emergency . I told Smitty just to tell you to call me when you called in . They told me it was an emergency . Do you have any cookies ? I need you to run a check on Peter 's dad , find out if he has a record or anything . Why ca n't you ? I kind of ran out of favors . Is it to my advantage for the guy to have a record ? Either way , Paris is taking some time away from Chandler . What 's his name ? I 'll have to find out . So here we go again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Chandler . Chandler 's got the potential to be a great dad , a dad I can be proud of . And I care about him , and he cares about me . But your dad still cares about you , too . And you can still care about him and care about Chandler . Look , I do n't need any of your sage advice . This is why I did n't tell you about it in the first place . And what do you know about it ? You 're a Camden . I ca n't believe you . I was listening . I admit it . I ca n't believe I sunk so low , but I did . I apologize . I 'll never do it again . It 's just you left me downstairs , wondering ... No excuses , I was wrong . Okay , I guess you owe me . So I 'm assuming you know that Mrs . Petrowski went out for coffee with the ex - Mr . Petrowski . Paris and Chandler are having a big fight about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler was going to be his new dad , and I do n't think he wants his old dad back . Chandler ? Did Kevin tell you ? No , I did n't . We have milk . I thought I heard somebody . What is going on ? ( sighs ) Paris is seeing her ex . She wants to give him a second chance . She wants Peter to give him a second chance . And you were hoping to make Paris your wife and be a dad to Peter , I know . Who told you ? Nobody had to tell me . You 're going to have to let them go . Let them all have their second chance , because that 's really all you can do . All you can do that you would feel good about , anyway .

But then , you know , Eric came back , you stepped aside and kind of lost your footing . Not that you did n't do everything that anyone ever asked you to do , but you 've been waiting to be asked . And you do n't have to do that . The church needs you . The community needs you . The world needs you . So do something . Make a contribution . Good night . Hey , there 's some hidden brownies in the drawer under the dish towels . And , um , there 's plenty of milk in the frig . Did you have her say that ? Hey , look who 's here , the guy we like . ( stammering ) : I 'm sorry . I really have to get to work . I wo n't keep you . I just , uh , have something that I want to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week when I talked to Peter about , uh ... well , my intentions . But , uh ... I 'm glad that both of you know how much I care about you . I would n't want either of you , well , especially Peter , to think that I was abandoning you . I still want to see you . I still want to talk to you . But only if and when it 's appropriate . And , Peter , I think that we need to let your mom decide that . And I know that you have a lot to think about . But if you need my help with anything , or get lonely , or , uh , you just miss me ... Please , uh , just let me know . What , are you afraid of a little competition ? Peter . It 's not a competition . If it was , I 'd jump right in and fight to the finish . But it 's not . He 's your dad . This is n't about me . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am glad you dropped by . But I 've got to get to work and I better get Peter to school . I want to talk to my dad alone , man to man . No , I think I should be there . I think if any adult has to be there , it should be Kevin . Kevin ? I 'd be safe with Kevin . And I have some things to say to my dad that I do n't think I should say in front of you or a reverend . Please do n't tell me that after what he did I ca n't say anything . I mean , I 've been waiting all this time to say plenty . I-I just think that your dad would be uncomfortable talking to you with Kevin there . He does n't even know Kevin . What about what I 'm comfortable with ? ( sighs ) Okay , I 've got to get to work . Listen , let me think about this , okay ? Let me talk to your dad . Wait . Please . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom , it 's been me and you for the past three years . You 've made all the big decisions , and you 've let me be a part of that decision making . Do n't cut me out now . Please . You know , you 're right . You are absolutely right . If your dad wants to talk to you and you want Kevin there , then you should have Kevin there . I 'll let him know . Come on . So while you continue to help individuals and save the world one person at a time , what I thought I could do is gather up all the young people in the congregation who have n't found who they want to help or what they want to do yet , and get them all together as a team . And we could make ourselves available to community groups , or social services , uh , veteran 's organizations , local charities , global charities or whoever needs us , but only if it 's okay with you . Oh , it 's more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my help , let me know . Otherwise , I 'll just , I 'll stay out of your way . Thanks for supporting me . I 'm excited to get started . I 'm here to see Reverend Camden . Are you ? No , I 'm not . It 's the first door on the right . Reverend Camden ? Oh , Vic Petrowski ? Vickery . George Vickery . People just call me Vic . Petrowski 's her name , and I allowed for Peter 's name to be changed . Thought it 'd be easier for them at the time . ' Course at the time , I was drunk . Have a seat . I 'm happy you could stop by . Believe me , I did n't want to . I was hoping for just a simple conversation between my ex-wife and my son . But , if this is what she wants , then this is what I 'll give her . What would you like to know ? Let 's see , um , I went through rehab . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Um , I have a job . A crummy job ; I teach art to a bunch of loser at St . George Community College . Yeah , I 'm a freakin ' art teacher . So I guess you 're also an artist ? ( chuckles ) : Not really , whatever . I 'm sorry if you felt this meeting was forced on you . Paris thought I could be of more help to her and Peter in discussing this reunion if I knew you a little better . Right . So if you like me , you 'll get Peter to talk to me . Yeah , great . Nobody likes me . But it never stopped me from living my life . Look , I did n't get sober for nothing . So let 's just get on with this , all right ? All right . You mind if I ask , are you in AA ? Is n't that Alcoholics Anonymous ? Yes , it is . I 'm sorry . I 'm not in it . I 'm not an alcoholic . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about you ? Do you like you ? Truthfully , not that much , no . But I 'm not changing for anybody , even me . Giving up alcohol is about as far as I want to go with self-improvement . I do n't have to be any better than I am right now for my son to love me . And that 's the way I see it . You were n't nice drunk , and the two or three times I remember you even being sober , you were n't nice then , either . You stink as a father , and you stink as a husband . I do n't care how much money you coughed up . You ca n't buy us back . You 're a lousy , no good , rotten piece of ... MARTIN : Whoa . You ca n't talk to your father like that . Why not ? That 's what I think of him . Still , if I talked to my father like that , I 'd be picking myself up off the ground . Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if I talked to him like that , I think the chances would be good that he would . My father 's in the Marines . You ca n't talk to a Marine like that ... or a dad like that . If you ask me , a father/son relationship is about honor and respect , and I 'd suggest being honorable and respectful , no matter how upset you are . Sorry , maybe you should ask someone else . Are you quoting from a movie ? No , I 'm saying what 's in my head . I 've been rehearsing it for years . I think you should rehearse something else . You ca n't say any of that . ( sighs ) I do n't think I should even see the guy , but I have to , and if I have to , I 'm gon na say how I feel . Okay , fine . Say what 's in your heart , but use your head . Know what I mean ? Yeah , I know just what you mean , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ask somebody else about this . You can ask me . I promise I wo n't give you any of my " sage advice , " as you call it . Forget it . I 'm looking for someone who will agree with me . You ca n't talk to your dad like that . I understand that you 're angry , but you 'd be getting off to a really bad start . That 's the nice version . What would you say ? Dad , I 'm very happy and proud that you stopped drinking , but I 'm still angry with you for the years that you did drink , for the years that you were n't so nice to Mom and me , and I 'd like to tell you how it felt when you left us , because it was hard for us , maybe a lot harder than you realized . This is why I asked Kevin to take me . You Camdens have really lived a sheltered life . Just give me a few minutes to change , and I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready , Peter can run his speech to his dad past you , and maybe you can help him with it . I could , but I think Peter should say whatever he wants to say . ( sighs ) Well , how 'd it go with Peter 's dad ? I was reminded what a complex and difficult task it is for us ... to love one another . I somewhat hope that Peter has the guts to tell Vic what a mean , rotten guy he is , ' cause I spent a couple of hours making him try to come to that conclusion himself and do something about it , ' cause ... he wants to be loved , and I think he 'd respond to being loved ... by anyone . But unless something shifts , believe me , he 's gon na remain an island of self-loathing and self-hatred , forcing himself on the only people he can , Peter and Paris . I do n't think that 's to Vic 's benefit , and it certainly is n't to Peter or ... or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or anything anyone can do ? My gut feeling is that we need to circle the wagons and just surround this man with as much love as we can muster , and I 'd love to lead the way , but I 'm exhausted from just trying not to smack him with the newspaper that was on my desk . * * You had to bring a cop ? You thought I 'd do something stupid ? Actually , I thought I 'd do something stupid . I thought I was going to tell you how much you ... Go ahead . I was n't counting on being happy to see you . But you are , right ? Sort of . It 's just that ... Just that what ? I 'm heavier than you remember ? I 'm balder , older ? It 's still me , kid . I know , but you were n't very nice to Mom or to me when I last saw you . Yeah , I know . ( @clicks_tongue ) But ... I 'm still your father . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , I know , but you left without even saying good-bye , and you never even called , not even on my birthday or Christmas . Well , once I was out of the house , I did n't want to come back until I was back on my feet and sober . I did n't know it was going to take this long . And I did n't want to spoil your birthday or Christmas by calling . You might not want to hear from me . Yeah , I guess I did n't . But I did n't really want to hear from you now , either . Things have been going really good for Mom and me . Yeah , well , now things can go even better for all of us , especially your old dad . Why now ? Really ?

That 's tomorrow . Yes , it is . How would you like to help a really nice group of people move into a new home ? Okay .

Maybe Martin and Cecilia would like to get involved . We 're going . We 're involved already . And do n't forget to ask Peter . Uh , about spending time with Chandler ? Is that a good idea ? What makes me think you 're up to something ? I was wondering the same thing . Hi . Hey . Kevin went home . So , how-how 'd it go , you two ? Okay . Good even . Thanks for making me do this . Uh , Dad , this is Ruthie and Cecilia and Martin . VIC : Oh , yeah . You 're the Marine 's kid , huh ? When are you signing up , next month ? I 'm only 16 , but when I 'm 18 , yeah , I might . Why ? Was that a crack at the Marines ? Calm down . It was n't a crack . I 'm just being friendly . Apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? No . It 's like an orphanage , only the , uh , kids have parents waiting for them at home , huh ? Well , if you guys are all done staring at me , I think I 'll go home . Peter , I 'll call you tomorrow . Paris good night . Good night . We-We better be going , too . ( @door_closes ) Yeah , good night . ( sighs ) Everything 's gon na be fine . ( @door_closes ) LUCY : Ah . So Kevin says everything went pretty well . I do n't know how that happened . Does Peter have to see his father ? Well , it 's not a matter of having to see him . Most children want to see their mom and dad , no matter who they are or what they 've done to them . And since we all love Peter , we 're going to find a way to love Vic . So what 's your plan ? All will be revealed in due time . In due time . Hiding ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about this group of people that Chandler 's going to help tomorrow ? I know they 're nice people , and I think they have something to teach us all . About loving Vic ? Mm-hmm . Does Chandler know that he and his project are being used for your project ? Well , Chandler wo n't mind when he understands that it's-it 's also to his benefit . When are you going to tell him ? Uh ... All right . ( @phone_beeps_on , touchtonessounding ) ( @phone_ringing ) Eric ! How did you know it would be me ? Because I finally figured out that you were the only person that knew about my idea , so you must have made a phone call . Well , I-I was inspired . I-I acted in the moment . It 's okay . I 'm grateful to jump in and get going , so thank you . You 're welcome . Okay , what do n't I know ? Can I come up ? Sure . I brought pie . I did n't want to show up uninvited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I met his dad . Wow . By the way , we need help moving some people tomorrow . What people ? I do n't know . Just some people that Chandler said he 'd help move . Fine with me . We 're out of milk . Could you get it , Kevin ? I need a sister right now . Ever since Peter 's dad came around , he 's been angry with me . He does n't want to talk to me . He does n't think that I 'll be able to understand what he 's going through because we 're Camdens , and our parents never divorced . This was a sudden change for Peter , and I think he was a little scared and angry before he sat down and talked to his dad . You should see his dad . I mean , I 'm surprised he was n't more scared and angry after he sat down and talked to him . Yeah . Kevin met him . He had the same reaction . I do n't know why Peter 's angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was okay if he wanted his dad in his life . I told him he could love his mom and Chandler , and his dad , too . It may have seemed that you were giving Peter permission to love his father , when he had n't yet given himself permission . He has to get to know him again . None of us know his dad . We do n't know if we like him or not . We do n't know if he 's capable of being a positive addition to Peter 's life or not , and that 's none of our business anyway . That 's Paris 's and Peter 's business . All we know is that we love Peter , and he 's a positive addition to our lives . So what I think Dad 's in the process of doing is making it easier for all of us to accept Vic into our circle , so we do n't push Paris and Peter out . Especially while they 're vulnerable and scared and going through a difficult time . How 's he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a big secret , but we 'll find out tomorrow . Thanks , sis . I really needed that . ( @laughs_quietly ) What ? We have milk . I know . Thanks . ( @phone_ringing ) ( @phone_beeps_on ) Yeah ? I finally got the information you wanted . Nothing . Squeaky-clean . Not so much as a parking ticket . Thanks . Think Paris will go back with him ? I kind of doubt it . But there 's nothing wrong with him . Oh , there 's plenty wrong with him . There 's just nothing legally wrong with him , but thanks . ( @phone_beeps_off ) ( @dial_tone , @phone_beeps_off ) Ca n't you get in trouble for running checks on people all the time for no reason ? Yes . Nevertheless , that never stops you or your family from asking . ( @phone_ringing ) Hello . Hi . I just wanted to say good night and thanks for introducing me to your dad . I was gon na call you . You were ? I 'm sorry if I 've been a jerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what you 're going through , and I just want to say that I hope you still have room for me in your life no matter how things go with your dad . Always . But just so you know , I 'm kind of expecting my life to be a little like a roller coaster now that he 's shown up . I do n't think this is gon na be an easy ride , and I do n't know if we 're gon na make it back safely , or if everything 's just gon na break down again . Is there anything I can do for you ? I 'm bringing my dad over to the house tomorrow and we 're all gon na help Chandler move those people in . So , if he gets mean , or insulting or anything , if you could just , well , not judge him or anything , or judge me because he 's my dad , that would be great . I know people do n't always like him , I do n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is my dad . No problem . It 'll be a problem , but thanks . Good night . Good night . ( sighs ) I do n't know how I would have gotten done today without your help . Most of the parents are like me , too old to be much good for physical labor . Of course that 's why we have to do this , because the parents are older . And when they pass away , the children have to have some place to go . ( grunts ) Relatives - - they do n't usually want to take ' em , and social services is n't the place . ' Cause they 've always had a home . You know it 's hard to get people to adopt adults , but some of them do take them in . I 've just been waiting for a ... a house to become available in my neighborhood that my wife and I could afford to help buy . ( sighs ) There 's John , my son . I 'm so proud of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honorable profession you 've chosen . Yeah , well , my dad passed away last summer , and honestly , he never really liked the idea of me being a minister . Oh , I 'm sorry to hear about your dad . I 'm sorry to hear that he never told you he was proud of you . But you take my word , fathers are all proud when their sons succeed . And you 've obviously done very well with your life , Chandler . You 're a good man . Hi . So you 're the minister of the church . Uh , my official title is Associate Pastor . That 's nice . Yeah . Would you marry me ? Uh ... He thinks you want to marry him . No , I meant , would you marry me to my boyfriend . Oh . Of course . Of course , I can do that . But first you got ta get a boyfriend . Yeah . That 's first . Thank you . Where did John find his housemates ? Oh , they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with anything that anyone needs help with . You know , delivering packages , or pick up lunches , help out at corporate events , almost anything . You know , they 've worked together for so long , that Mrs . Thomas and I have become close friends with the other parents , also the kids . ' Course they 're not kids anymore . Looks like a clown car . ( @all_laugh ) Is , uh , Peter coming with you , or is he coming with his dad ? Oh , he 's coming with his dad . Ah . Good . That's-that 's good , I guess . After I finish this , I 'm gon na go get the smoke detectors . You need a new one in here , and we should put one in the hallway . And what can I do ? I am good with money , so if you have any budget problems . And I 'm a mom , so I can cook and clean and do laundry . That 's nice of you to offer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have ? Oh , just one , Peter . What 's your husband 's name ? Uh , well , I 'm divorced , but his name is Vic . He , uh , he has n't been around in the past few years . In fact , this weekend is the first time he 's seen Peter in ... three years . They 're supposed to come by later and help out . I 'm sorry . This must be a hard time for you . And it must be scary for you , too . ( sighs ) Yeah , it is . I never even thought to offer Paris any sympathy . I know . Me neither . I did n't even say anything to her . I think this is one of the many lessons my dad was hoping we 'd learn here today . Are you excited about moving into a house with your friends ? I have to . My mom is making me because if I stay at home with her , when she dies I 'll be all alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dead . Do you have a father ? No , he died when I was young . Who are you going to live with when your mother dies ? I live with my wife Lucy . We live in her family 's garage apartment , so we have lots of family around . That 's good . I 'm sure your dad is happy when he looks down and sees you . We just attempted our first ceiling fan installation . How 'd you make out ? Uh , we were thinking maybe we should get Annie over here a little sooner . I bet Lucy could help . I could ask Lucy . I 'm not afraid to ask for help . Oh , thanks , but I should ask her ... like he told me to an hour ago . I 'll go with you . Martin can help Richard move this table inside . I heard you play baseball . Yeah , I do . How did you learn to play baseball ? My dad . That 's wonderful . You 'll always have that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom and little brothers are bringing lunch over for everyone . ( laughs ) What ? You 're not waiting for your mother . No , I 'm not . I 'm waiting for my boyfriend Peter . He 's coming over with his dad . Do you like Peter 's dad ? I 'm trying to , but ... you 'll see . Everything will be fine . You know how I know ? No . Because everything is fine . Peter and Vic are here . Hey . They 're here . Wait till you see this . You 're not going to believe it . Hi , I 'm Peter . This is my dad Vic . Hi . ( tearing ) Oh , you stupid idiot . Moron , jackass ! Pinhead ! I think he 's talking about him , not us . I painted this . I wanted to give you guys something for your house . I ca n't believe I ripped it . I 'm such a ... Can we see it ? Wow . ( gasping ) It 's beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not perfect . Nothing 's perfect . Come on , I stink . So you 're not perfect either . We all love you . We love you . Thank you , Peter 's dad . You 're great . Good work . You 're wonderful , Peter 's dad . Thank you very much . Okay , that 's nice , thank you . That 's a nice group hug . I appreciate it . He might be all right , and whether he is or is n't , we love you . Thank you , Cecilia . When we get finished here , you feel like going to the batting cages ? Just the two of us ? Maybe we 'll take Richard . I think he 'd like it . What ? I was just thinking how great it is to have a wife and a family . It 's amazing . You said to expect a miracle and there are little miracles happening all around us . In matters of the heart , always best to go to those with the biggest hearts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

You obviously do n't hear too good . Oh , I hear fine . It 's just that ... we filmmakers live by our own code . There 's tradition at stake . You may have heard of some of our more arcane sayings such as ... " always leave them [laughing] , " and " the show must go on . " We believe in those expressions , we live by them . So , we 've decided to ignore your less-than-courteous order to leave . What are you ? A total fruitcake ? You 're 300 miles out in the brush . I could kill you and nobody would even ask any questions . What if I decided to kill you instead ? [all_laughing] Well , you certainly got gall . Well , how are you gon na kill me ? Throw a megaphone at me ? Well , obviously I have something in mind . I mean , the way I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends ... and put your cute little 4-wheelers in reverse and pull out of here ... or try me out , in which case ... we 'll have to bury you with your boots on . Probably right about where your foot is . That 's quite a good trick ... considering I 'm the one who 's holding the gun . Allow me to familiarize you ... with certain military logistics . You see , you have no position here . You 're on low ground . B.A . [gun_firing] And you 're flanked on both sides . Murdock ! Face . You see ... you elected to station your men out in the open ... without any cover . I could kill you . Yeah . But you 'd be dead before I hit the ground , so put it up . Murdock , incinerate this bag of spit on the count of three . One , two ... . ( B.A . ) Drop ' em . Now , you wan na see something that 'll break your heart ? Look down the barrel . Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jer , hit the rest of the plungers . And then ... there is perhaps the most arcane expression of them all . " There is no business like show business . " [B.A._chuckling] [birds_chirping] Open the gate . Matey 's back . Hey , that 's not our truck . Hey , wait a minute . Hey ! Come back here . Hey ! Put it down or I hit the gas . Tell your men to drop their weapons . Drop your weapons ! It 's an order . Do it now ! I do n't know who you are - - l know . I know . But I know who you are . You 're Major Ramon De Jero . You 've terrorized hundreds of people , tortured them unmercifully . I can pay you . I 'm sure you can , but we 're not in that market . Captain , take a look at this guy 's basement . See if he 's been pulling off anybody 's fingernails down there . All right , come on , Face . Bring your nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , call a taxi . They threw me in this basement . They probably did n't realize they was dealing with a star , sweet cheeks . See what happens when you do n't live up to your contractual obligations ? The movie gods gets you . What have you done ? Why have you brought all these men here ? This guy in the white suit ... is a war criminal . You lock him up . I 'll get the federales down here . They 'll take him away in a rabies bag . What 's wrong ? Perhaps you should tell him , jefe . He has all our wives and children . They 're being held in a place out of town ... and if I am locked up , they will be killed . You see , I 'm a man who enjoys good insurance . Which is why I have lived so long and so well . What makes you think I wo n't be able to find them and rescue them ? You wo n't get the opportunity , senor . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , no , no , not me , but perhaps you should look around you , senor . [guns_cocking] Not bad . Drop your weapons . This is a real neat town you found , Faceyman . I know . [crickets_chirping] This is awful . I knew I should n't have gotten into movie-making . I should have just stuck to being an agent . Maybe if we tell him we 'll do anything he wants , promise not to tell on him . Maybe , then he 'll let us go . I mean , he seems like a reasonable man . If we beg him , maybe . Jenny . She can go to him , convince him . Charles ! Do n't you think you 're working this heroic leading man thing too much ? ( Hannibal ) What we need is a good plan . I 'm open to suggestions . Well ... . Suggestions are one of my long suits . Yup . So , I suggest ... that we convince this tyrant that we have ... secret weapons in our possession ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , somebody shut this lunatic up . I 've been trying to shut this lunatic up for 15 years . Ai n't no way of shutting him up . But I 'd rather listen to him jibber-jabber , than to you whine . Well , there 's got to be a way . Then let 's go , Murdock , what 's the idea ? Well , most of you know me first of all , as H.M . Murdock . But in my movie career , I 'm known far and wide by my stuntman 's name . Look , Murdock , I do n't wan na hear no stuff about no Tommy Danger . Well , then , you better stuff some of that gold in your ear , big guy ... because I 'm on a roll . My stuntman persona is ... Tommy Danger . I 'm known best of all for my high falls , and my helicopter stunts . But foremost , especially and most spectacularly ... for my death scenes . Tommy Danger is known far and wide ... for his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , you heard me . He can take a bullet better than any man alive . Now , I suggest ... that Hannibal shoot me ... and then turn his attention to Jerry the German out there ... and scare him into surrendering and ... I also suggest ... that he use ... this ordinary pen ... which I will turn into a deadly ... 3-shot repeater . Observe . [mimicking_gunshot] [groaning] Ringo ... Ringo , please , please do n't let me die with my boots on . I like it . Now , all we need is a squib . Beautiful . What 's this all about , Johnny ? We just came up with an escape plan . We must move quickly . It 's become very sloppy . Tell Marco Cortez to clear out our accounts in Argentina ... and bring the money here immediately . We will fly to Switzerland and then go on to the island . I do n't want to argue about it . Do as I say ! This was supposed to be a quiet place ... to rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood filmmakers ... who disarm my security forces . They may have called for help . Who knows what they may have done ? We have little time . They got lucky . Anybody can get lucky . Who counts on luck to decide anything ? Tomorrow morning , at dawn ... you will take these men to the ranch where the women are being held . Kill them all . And then go on to the town and kill the men there . Set a fire . Nobody must be left to tell of my existence . There 's no reason to kill 30 people . It 'll bring the police , it 'll cause an international incident . If they know that I was here ... they will find a way to trace me to the island . Somebody will remember the tail number of the helicopter ... that brought me here , or will remember that ... I made several calls to Geneva . Or , your description . You were seen on the island . A composite drawing perhaps , that will be circulated . Bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must all be eliminated . And if that ... is not reason enough ... consider this . Okay , mate , you made your point . I knew you were here , De Jero . I could smell you . That the best you can do ? You will be taken to a field where a large hole has been dug . You will be shot and buried . No one , not even the buzzards , will know you are there . Not a very graceful conclusion ... to an exciting life , do you think ? Put them in the truck . B.A . , I ca n't pull this off with my hands tied . [grunting] I think I dislocated my shoulder . This stuff must be 1000-pound test . Get ready . [groans] Okay , you guys know what to do . I need talk to somebody . I got things to tell . They got weapons . Shut up , Murdock . Do n't you tell me to shut up . You shut up yourself . Who are you ? You brought me down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na die . I want to go home . He 's got a gun and he 's gon na kill you ! Who 's got a gun ? He does ! Damn you , Murdock ! ( Hannibal ) Drop your weapon . No , do n't fire . It 's a trick , get the women ! You 're coming with me for protection , pal . Please ! No ! Stop ! Please ! Do n't ! Stop , stop . How 'd I do , Colonel ? How 'd I do ? Oh , it was a great death scene , Murdock . One of the best . Now , this was an E-ticket ride . You did n't get your coupon . But , who cares when you 're having fun ? ( Decker ) I know this guy 's one weakness ... is playing these geek monsters . He 's gon na show . I 'm going in . Captain , you 're with me .

Do n't even know what he looks like . I just got a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave me to write him back . He used to be a sailor . He 's a janitor of some building here . - A janitor ? - Sure . And I was thinking , seeing he ai n't done a thing for me in my life he might be willing to stake me with a room and eats until I could rest up . But I ai n't expecting much from him . Give you a kick when you 're down , that 's what all men do . And I do n't suppose he 'll turn out no better than the rest . Do you hang around this dump much ? Oh , off and on . Why , maybe you know him , my old man . Well , it ... It is n't old Chris , is it ? - Who , old Chris ? - Yeah , Chris Christopherson . - That 's his full name . - That 's him .

Where 'd you get the idea that he was a janitor ? Well , he wrote me he was himself . He 's lying . He 's a captain on a barge . A barge ? What kind of a barge ? Well , coal , mostly . A coal barge ? Well , well . If that ai n't a swell job to find your long-lost old man working at . Oh , gee . Well , that puts the kibosh on his giving me a rest . Why ? Could n't you live on it too ? Who , me ? On a dirty coal barge ? Well , what do you think I am ? Well , what do you know about a barge ? Bet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes of him bringing you up inland where you 'd be safe . Say , his bringing me up , is that what he tells people ? Well , I sure like his nerve . Why , he let them cousins keep me on the farm and work me to death like a dog . Well , you did n't fall for that farm life , did you ? I should say not . I had to slave for all of them . Was all right till my mother died but I was only a poor relation , you know and they treated me worse than they dared treat a hired girl . Oh , what a life on that farm out in Minnesota . With them Swedes , woman-hungry . One night I was alone in the house and one of the sons came back . After that , I hated them , so I 'd kill them all if I stayed so I ran away . St . Paul . Yeah , I overheard Chris saying as how you was in St . Paul . - Working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went there to work , but I was still a kid . It 's all men 's fault , giving you the wrong start . I 'm just out of the hospital two weeks . The judge gave all of us girls 30 days . Well , the others did n't seem to mind being in the cooler much . But I could n't stand it . I went nuts . I never could stand being caged up nowhere . I got good and sick , and they had to send me to the hospital . And it was nice there . I was sorry to leave it , honest . If my old man does n't help me it 's men again . Men all the time . Oh , how I hate them , every mother 's son of them . Do n't you ? Well , there 's good one's and there 's bad one's , you know . Now , your old man , old Chris . Oh , he 's a good one , honest . Well , he 'll have to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , he 's kind of simple . He 's got nutty notions . You know , he thinks that ... He thinks you 're working as a nurse girl in St . Paul . You know , he thinks that ... He means all right , honest . He thinks the world of you . Honest , he does . Quit your kidding . Well , as soon as I get rested up I 'll clear out and get back to the old job in St . Paul .

I feel sort of strange tonight . Sort of nutty as if I 've been living a long , long time out here in the fog . I do n't know just how to tell you what I mean . But it 's like I 've come home from a long visit someplace and I seem to have forgotten all that 's happened . Like it did n't matter anymore . You must think I 'm off my base .

Well , we 're safe anyhow , with the help of God . Sure , it 's me , Matt Burke himself , dreaming again . You drink this and you 'll find it 's no dream . The devil with the drink . But I 'll be taking it anyhow . Sure , I 'm needing that . It 's fine stuff . But it was n't the drink I meant when I said , was I dreaming . Sure , I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea , come to torment me . Aye , real flesh and blood , devil the less . Cut that . What 's a fine , handsome woman the like of yourself doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great one , honest . Starting right in kidding after what you 've been through . I 'm telling you , but for the strength and guts in me , we 'd be scoffed by the fishes this minute . Gee , you hate yourself , do n't you ? But you must come and lie down and go to sleep . Lie down and sleep , is it ? But you 'll not be thinking I 'm a weak scut . Sure , I could lick any man on this boat with one hand tied behind me back . I could lick all hands on this tub one by one , tired as I am . Ai n't you the hard guy , though , huh ? But never mind that fight talk . I 'll take your word for what you say . You 're all in , own up to it . The devil I am . Well , be stubborn , then , for all I care . And I must say I do n't care for your language . The men I know do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Let you not be making game of me . Whisht , now , milady , it 's one of your kisses I 'm needing to take the tiredness from me bones . One kiss , now . Let go of me , you ... ! Oh , gee , I was scared for a moment I 'd killed you . " Killed you , " you say ? Faith , it would take more than a bit of a blow to crack my thick skull . Glory be , you got a power of strength in them fine arms of yours . Forget it . I 'm sorry it happened . Only , you 've no right to be getting fresh with me . Listen , now , do n't go getting any more wrong notions . I 'm on this barge because I 'm making a trip with my father . The captain is my father . Now you know . I 'm sorry . I 'm thinking I 'm not good enough to kiss the shoe soles of a fine , decent girl the like of yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends from this out ? I 'm thinking I 'd rather be friends with you than anything else in the world . - Sure . - God bless you . It is a clumsy ape I am . Sure , it is great power I have in me hand and arm , and I do be forgetting it at times . You 're sure strong , all right . Sure , it is the will of God in it that brought me safe through the storm to the one spot in the world where you was . Think of that , now , and is n't it queer ? Anna , you get in cabin , you hear ? Who do you think you 're talking to , a slave ? You need to rest , Anna . What are you doing here , you sailor fella ? You ai n't sick like others . You get in forecastle , they give you bunk .

Weak as I am , I can break you in pieces and throw you over the side , and your crew after you . I was forgetting , you 're her old man . Sure , I 'd not lift a fist to you for the world . Come inside . You can have my bed if there is no other place . That 's your dirty trick , old devil but you do n't do that , no , not that while I live . Mulligan ! Sure , it is myself that 's hungry . And a pie , Matt . Glory be , what do I care for a stew or a pie ? It 's not for food I 'm hungry but for the sight of your face . - Oh , go on with your blarney , you gasbag . Now , Matt , look what you 've done . Pick that up . Shame on you . Sure , her with the face of an angel and the sting of a wasp . Oh , so it 's darning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice like a foghorn . What 's this ? Well , what do you think it is ?

Do n't make me jealous , or I 'll burn it up and him in it . - No . Give it to me . - You got a guilty look in your eye . Now , you give it to me , now . You bully . Now ... Do n't ! - Look what you 've done , galoot . - When I get ahold of him that wears it I 'll pull out an arm and wave you goodbye with it . Supper 's almost ready . Well , I 've been hungry . Well , as I was saying to you before ... Stand up , just to measure this sweater . Sure , I will . On me head or me feet ? Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can save you now , Anna . Well , I 'm praying , Matt . It is a miracle if your prayers are answered . Thanks , Matt . It 's for my father . And him hating to stand up for measurements . - Will you wear it for my sake ? - Oh , yeah . It is a lie in your throat and you know it . No , it is n't . You made it for me with your own blessed hands . And I 'll wear it when we dock in New York and take you out for a day 's fun . Oh , no , you wo n't . It wo n't be finished by then .

Sure , I 've air enough in me chest to blow up a balloon . Well , I do n't doubt it . What do you mean , you do n't doubt it ? I was just kidding . I bet he goes to 40 . Oh , boy . Step up and roll the sweet mamas out of their beds . Make your own sweet mama jealous . Only 25 cents to see the most enchanting scene on Coney Island . Now there 's Lily and Clytie without any nighties . Hey , you , step right up . Give us a good free look at the mamas in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night , tightwad ? Loosen up , lads . Give us a little tumble . I 'll bet you could n't hit that target if you stayed until you grew a long , white beard . - The devil I couldn't . - Come on , Matt . Go on and try it . Bet you ca n't even hit the net . - Yeah , how about a home run , Babe Ruth ? - Sure , I dare you to . With one throw , I could knock them dames off of their bunks . Go to it , big boy . Do n't overlook me , carrot top . I have the shape that makes the old men young and the young men old . - Attaboy . - Mama wants Papa . - Papa wants Mama . Some mamas too . Now somebody else .

Oh , sure , Anna , you 're crazy about me , and I 'm not after blaming you . You just hate yourself , do n't you , Matt ? Oyster loaf for the lady , sir . - I ordered milk for the lady . - Well , I 've got it here . Well , let 's drink to our good health . Here 's to you . And skoal , Matt , to you and me . - Hot mustard , Matt ? - I do n't need it . - Pepper ? - Full of it . - Well , here 's something you do need . - Oh , is that so , now ? Well , all right . But if I 'm needing sugar , I know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt . Just like a couple of kids . Sure , Anna , when you 're in love , you ai n't got the brains of a tick . What do you mean , love ? You know what I mean , Anna . It 's in me eye and on the tip of me tongue . A man like me ai n't given to loving a woman . He knows too much about them . Every color of them , from here to the China Sea . The whole lying , cheating smear of them . Sailors ' bait . When he comes across a girl like you , Anna that 's as clean as a shell . You 're a lucky girl to be hearing such talk from the lips of Matt Burke him that the women are so crazy over . Anna , what 's come over you ? Oh , nothing . Sure , do n't lie to me , Anna . You 're as stiff as a corpse . Hello , dearie . - Well , I 'll be ... - Well , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm afraid I do n't remember you . - She do n't remember me . - Of course she do n't , you old scab . - Beat it , or I 'll have you thrown in the brig . - No , Matt , maybe I do know her . That old sea cow ? Go on , clear out of here . You know a nice young girl never met the likes of you . A nice young ... ? A nice young ... Pure and white as a lily . Shut up , or I 'll choke the wind out of your gullet . Oh , Matt , let her alone . She do n't mean nothing by it . Anna . Anna , darling . You see what you 've done ? You frightened her . - Go on , clear out of here . - I 'm going , I 'm going . Let her alone . Do n't go . I was lying , Matt . I know her and she knows me . I recognized her the minute she stepped across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to spill over for nobody . You ai n't responsible for what your old man does . I 'll tell you why she did n't want to talk to me . Because I 'm a tramp , that 's why . And her old man kicked me off the barge when she come there to live on it . Yeah , he did n't want any old wharf rat around a nice young girl . Well , it ai n't so , though , Matt . She 's lying . Lying , I 'm ly ... ? Well , I like your nerve , all right , all right . Gee , I 'm sorry I came here to speak to you . Insulting me . Well , can you beat it ? I 'll be toddling along . I 'm glad you found yourself such a nice , friendly gent . I hope you 're happy , kid . I 'm sorry I bothered you , honest , I ... Oh , forget it , Ann . You only got one life to live . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skipper , you would n't stake me to a quarter , would you ? You know , I have n't had a drink in a month . Take it and beat it . With pleasure , captain . Well , so long . Be a good girl , Ann , no matter how lonesome . Happy days . Happy days . The poor old devil . Sometimes I feel sorry for them . Come on , Anna . Do n't let it get you down . Sure , the world 's full of them . I know it 's a sad sight for a decent young girl the like of yourself , darling . What would you say , Matt , if I told you that ... ? Say what , me darling ? Tell me what . Oh , nothing . Sure , I know what you 'll be wanting to tell me soon , if not this minute that you love me . Do n't be so sure of yourself , Matt . I 'm loving nobody . And you 'll be wanting to marry me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt . You want to marry me ? - Honest ? - Sure , I 'll marry you . Only , do n't be putting me to too many tests , or I might change me mind . I 'm tired , Matt . I wan na go back to the barge . You ... You think you love that sailor fella , Anna ? Well , what if I do ? You think maybe you marry him ? No . I 'm glad you do n't marry sailor , Anna . Is bad for woman . They do n't never see their men only once in long while . You sit and wait all alone and when their boys grow up and go on sea they sit and wait some more . Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool , I tell you . Your mother , she tell you same thing if she was alive . Well , that ai n't why I wo n't marry him . I 'm not thinking about myself but about him . He 's such a simple guy , a big kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . You fool him ? Oh , you go crazy , I think . I 've been thinking I was myself the last few days . I 'll be outside . I love to watch the ships passing . When Matt comes along , tell him where I am , will you ? All right , I tell him . Well , God bless who 's here . How 's the world treating you this afternoon , Anna 's father ? Oh , pretty good , if it ai n't for some fellas . Meaning me , do you ? Well , if you ai n't the funny old crank of a man . Where 's herself ? - Where 's Anna , I 'm after asking you . - She gone out to look on boat . Well , I 'll be going out to her . But before I go , I 'll take this chance while we 're alone to have a word with you . And that word is soon done . I 'm marrying your Anna before this day is out . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or no . That 's easy for saying . You mean I wo n't ? Is it yourself is after stopping me , do you think ? - I stop it if it come to worst . - Sure , it is n't trouble I 'm looking for . You 're her father . Would n't it be a shame for us to be at each others ' throats like a pair of dogs , and I married to Anna . So out with the truth , man alive . What is it you 're holding against me at all ? I do n't want my Anna for got married . Listen , you fella . I 'm old man . I do n't see my Anna for 15 year . She 's all I got in the world . You think now when she come on first trip , I want her for leave me alone again ? Sure , let you not be thinking I 've no heart at all for the way you 'd be feeling . Then you do right thing , eh ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big fella like you on sea , he do n't need a wife . He got new girl in every port , you know that . Oh , shut up . Sure , there 's a time come to every man , on sea or land when he 's sick of the lot of them cows , and wearing his heart out to meet up with some fine , decent girl and building a home to call his own , rearing up children in it . Sure , Anna 's the one woman in the world for me and I ca n't live without her now , I 'm thinking . You think I 'm going let her life be made sorry by you just like her mother 's was made by me ? No , she do n't marry you . Not if I have to kill you first . Glory be to God , what talk from a stumpy runt of a man . It is queer fool 's blather you have , about the sea done this and the sea done that . You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sailor . I 'm hearing a lot from you , and a lot more that Anna tells me you do be saying to her . I 'm thinking it is a poor weak thing you are . Not a man at all . You see if I 'm man maybe quicker than you think . You know the truth in your heart . The sea hit you a clout once and knocked you down . You 're not man enough to get up for another , but you lie there howling murder . I 'd like to see you in the best of your youth . - Do what I done in the storm and after . - Why , you young fool , you . In old days , when I was on windjammer I went through hundred storms worse than that . Ships were ships then , and men what sailing them real men . What you got on steamers now ? You got fellas on deck do n't know a ship from a mud scow and below deck , you got fellas just know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon ashore , you . Is it throwing insults at the men in the stokehold you are , you old ape ? One of them is worth any 10 squareheads ever shipped on a windbag . - You Irish swine . - So you do n't like the Irish , you old baboon ? Sure , it 's that you 're needing in your family . An Irishman . A man of the stokehold to put guts in it so you 'll not be rearing up grandchildren to be jackasses like yourself . Sure , old men getting childish should n't play with knives . Faith , I 've half a mind to hit you a clout will put sense in your square head . Keep away from me , now . Hello , Matt . Are you here already ? Say , what 's up ? How did that chair get knocked over ? Oh , Matt , you have n't been fighting with him , after you promised ? I 've not laid a hand on him , Anna . I told him to his teeth I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it . He tell same thing to girl in every port he goes . I know it 's true , Matt . Do n't you mind what he says . God bless you . And then I said I thought maybe you 'd have a bit of love for me too . So you told him that ? Maybe I have . I 've been wondering if I do love you . I did n't want to , I must own up to that . But I ... I guess I ca n't help it , so I guess I do . Oh , sure , I do , Matt . What 's the use of kidding myself different ? - Sure , I love you . - God be praised . And I have n't ever loved a man in my life before , never . Faith , we 'll be having a grand , beautiful life together to the end of our days . Matt . - Goodbye , Matt . - Goodbye , is it ? I 'll be coming at you in a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man when you 're beat fair and square . Here 's me hand to you . We 'll be friends from this out . No , I do n't shake hands with you , fella . Not while I live . The back of me hand to you , then , if that suits you . It 's a rotten bad loser you are , devil mend you . No , I do n't lose . Anna said she like you little bit . But you do n't hear her say she marry you , I bet . No , and I do n't hear her say the sun is shining , either . - No , I did n't say it , Matt . - There , you hear ? You 're waiting to be asked , you mean ? Well , I 'm asking you now . We 'll be wedded this day , with the help of God . - You heard what I said after I kissed you . - I do n't remember . I said goodbye . That kiss was for goodbye , Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We 've said goodbye , that 's all . - I knew that was so . - Is it making game of me you 'd be ? It 's a queer time to joke with me . Do n't be doing it , for the love of God . You do n't think I 'd kid you now . I 'm not joking , Matt . I mean what I say . You do n't . You ca n't . It is mad you are , I 'm telling you . - No , I 'm not . - What 's come over you so sudden ? You were saying you love me . I 'll say that as often as you want me to . It 's true . But why ? What ? What is it ? Because it 's the best way I can figure out , Matt . I 've been thinking it over and thinking it over , day and night , all week . Oh , do n't think it is n't hard on me too , Matt . Well , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of us has love ? I 'm thinking it 's listening to that old fool you are him hating me , filling your ears full of lies against me . Yes , Anna believe me , not you . She know her old father do n't lie like you . You sit down , do you hear ? Why do you come butting in and making things worse ? You 're like a devil , you are . Here I was , beginning to like you , beginning to forget all the things I 've held up against you . - You ai n't got nothing for hold against me . Have n't I , though ? Well , let me tell you . Matt , I 'm surprised at you . - You did n't think anything he 'd said ... - Sure , what else would it be ? Tell me , and do n't keep me waiting . I ca n't tell you , and I wo n't . I 've got a good reason , that 's all you need to know . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . So for heaven 's sake , let 's talk of something else . No , I 'll not . - Is it married to someone else you are ? - I should say not . You 're like them women ca n't make up their minds till they 're drove to it . Well , I 'll make up your mind for you . We 've had enough talk . Let 's go to the other room and dress in your best . We 're going ashore . - She do n't do that . - Where do you get that stuff ? Never mind , get on with your dressing . - We 'll see who 'll win in the end , me or you . - Stay , Anna . She will not . She 'll do what I say . You 've had your hold on her long enough . - It 's my turn now . - Your turn ? What am I anyway ? Never mind what you are . It 's what you 're gon na be : Wedded to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do one thing he say ! - She will ! - I 'm her father . - She will in spite of you . She 's taking my orders from now on , not yours . Orders is good . Never mind now . We 've no time to be wasting . - Do you hear what I 'm telling you ? - No , stay here , Anna ! You can go to blazes , both of you . You 'd think I was a piece of furniture . I 'll show you . Sit down . Sit down , do you hear ? Let me talk for a minute . You 're all wrong , see ? I 'm gon na tell you two something , and then I 'm gon na beat it . I 've been meaning to turn it loose on you every time you get my goat with your crazy talk about wanting to keep me safe inland . I was n't going to tell you , but you 've forced me into it . Oh , what 's the use ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way as any other . Do n't forget what you said about it not mattering to you what reason I got as long as I was n't married already . That 's me word , and I 'll stick to it . You make me laugh , honest . Wan na bet you will ? You wait and see . You was going on as if one of you had to own me . But nobody owns me , see , excepting myself . I 'll do what I please . And no man , I do n't give a darn who he is can tell me what to do . I ai n't asking either of you for a living . I 'll make it myself , one way or another . I am my own boss . Now , put that in your pipe and smoke it . - You and your orders . - I was n't meaning it that way at all and well you know it . You 've no call to raise this rumpus with me . - It is him , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you , you did mean it that way . You sounded just like all the rest . It is queer , rough talk , that , for a decent girl the like of yourself . Decent . Who told you I was ? I 'm talking to you now . I do n't want to hear . You go out your head , I think . Well , living with you is enough to drive anyone off their nut . Your bunk about the farm being so fine . Did n't I write you , year after year , how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made out of me ? What did you care ? Nothing . Not even enough to come out and see me . Your crazy stuff about wanting to keep me away from the sea do n't go down with me . You just did n't want to be bothered with me . - Oh , that ai n't so , Anna . - But one thing I never wrote you it was one of them cousins that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was none of my fault . I hated him and he knew it . But he was big and strong , like you . That 's why I ran away from the farm . That 's what made me get a job as a nurse girl in St . Paul . You think that was a nice job for a girl , too , do n't you ? With all them nice inland fellas just looking for a chance to marry me . They were n't looking for marrying . You do n't say nothing . Either one of you . But I know what you 're thinking . You 're just like all the rest . And who 's to blame for it ? Me or you ? If you 'd been a regular father and had me with you things would 've been different . - Do n't talk that way . - I go crazy . I wo n't listen to you . - You will listen . You , keeping me safe inland . I was no nurse girl the last two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house , that 's what . Yes , that kind of a house . The kind that sailors like Matt and you go to in port and your nice inland men too . And all men . I hate them , I hate them ... - Oh , it 's a lie , Anna , it 's a lie ... - So that 's what 's in it . I suppose you remember your promise . No other reason was to count with you as long as I was n't married already . You want me to get dressed and go ashore , do n't you ? Oh , yes , you do . I suppose if I tried to tell you that I was n't that no more you 'd believe me , would n't you ? And if I told you that just getting out on this barge and being on the sea had changed me and made me feel different about things as if all that I 've been through was n't me , did n't count it was just like it never happened you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , I 'm sure , if I told you that meeting you that funny way that night in the fog and afterwards , seeing that you were straight good stuck on me had got me to thinking for the first time in my life . And I sized you up as different from the one's on land , as water is from mud . I could n't marry you with you believing a lie . And I was ashamed to tell you the truth . And now , give me a bawling-out and beat it like I can tell you 're going to . Will you believe it if I tell you that loving you has made me clean ? It 's straight goods , honest . Oh , yes , you will . You 're just like all the rest . The rest , is it ? My curse on you . Clean , is it ? Oh , do n't , Matt . Get out of here . Let me alone . Get out of here ! I 'll be going . And I 'll be drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours off me lips ! And I 'd be getting dead , rotten drunk so I 'll not remember you at all ! I 'll ship away on a boat to the end of the world , where I 'll never see your face again ! - Oh , do n't go . It 's better Anna marry you ... - Let go of me , you old ape ! Marry her , is it ? I 'd see her dead at me feet first . I 'm shipping away out of this , I 'm telling you . My curse on you , and the curse of all the saints . - I go ashore too . - Not after him , I tell you . Do n't you dare . Oh , I go for get drink . I 'm driving you to drink too , huh ? You wan na get drunk so you can forget , like him . Aye . You think I like hear them things ? Oh , Anna . Anna , I think you was n't that kind of girl . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't want me here disgracing you , I suppose . Oh , no , no , Anna . You stay here . It ai n't your fault , I know that . It 's that old devil do this to me . It was all right on barge , with just you and me . Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog . That fella , he do n't never come , you do n't never tell me them things . I do n't never know . Then everything is all right . Oh , that dirty devil sea . Oh , what 's the use ? Go ashore and get drunk . You wait here , Anna ? Maybe . Maybe not . Maybe I 'll get drunk too . Maybe I 'll ... 0h , what do you care what I do ? Go on and beat it . It 's foggy outside . Oh , God . - What 's the trouble ? Feeling sick ? - Inside my head feels sick . Oh , Anna , you think maybe sometime you forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Oh , Anna lilla . Oh , do n't bawl about it . There ai n't nothing to forgive anyway . It ai n't your fault , it ai n't mine . It ai n't his , neither . I fix everything all right for you and me , Anna . Yes ? Then you and me will stick together ? We 'll work for each other and help each other , huh ? - What is it you fixed ? - Well , I sign on steamer Londonderry . Sail for Cape Town tomorrow . Oh , Anna , I only bring you bad luck . That 's how you fix me , is it ? Well , I think that old devil get me back maybe she leave you alone , then . Oh , ca n't you see that you 're doing the same thing that you 've always done ? Ca n't you see that ? Oh , what 's the use of talking ? You ai n't right . I 'll never blame you anymore . Oh , Anna . You forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame . You 're just what you are , like me . And you , you let me kiss you once again , eh ? - Oh , sure , no hard feelings . - Oh , Anna lilla . I ca n't say it , Anna . I think I go lie down , go to sleep . Oh , that booze , he do n't go well , Anna . I think I 'm never going to drink again . I ca n't stand this much longer . What am I waiting for , anyhow , like a darn fool ? Anna ? - Anna ? - Yes , what do you want ? Do n't say it . I know what 's in your mind . Yes , that 's what I was , and that 's what I 'm going back to . I 'd kill you first . And finish it up . It 's a dog 's life I been living since I found out what you are . Oh , why do n't you leave me alone . Go away . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep kicking me for ? Do n't you deserve the worst I 'd say , God forgive you ? All right , maybe I do . But do n't rub it in . Why have n't you done what you said you were going to ? Ship away to the other side of the earth , where you do n't have to see me . - I have . - What ? You 're going away , honest ? I signed on , drunk as I was , and she 's sailing tomorrow . - Where is she going ? Far away ? - Cape Town . It is at the end of Africa . That 's far for you . - What 's the boat 's name ? - The Londonderry . The Londonderry ? Oh , this is too much . Faith , I do n't blame you for laughing at me . True , it is the fool of the world I am to come back to talk to you at all . Oh , what 's the use ? What 's the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna ... Anna , if I could only be believing I was the only man in the world ever you had love for , I could be forgetting the rest , maybe . Are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love , with them ? You fool , you . I 've stood enough from you . Love them , is it ? I hated them , I tell you . And may God strike me dead , and my mother too , if she was alive if I 'm not telling you the honest truth . Oh , sure , Anna , if I could only be believing you , now . Why , Matt , you 've got to believe it . What can I do ? What will I do to prove to you I 'm not lying ? Anna , would you ... ? Would you be willing to swear an oath , a terrible , fearful oath ? Oh , sure , I will , Matt , on anything . Would you swear on this ? Oh , sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me by me mother , God rest her soul . And I 'm telling you , it has great power in it . And I 'm warning you now , if you swear on this it is me old woman herself who 'd be looking down on you from heaven and praying the saints to put a curse on you if she hears you swear a lie . I would n't have the nerve , honest , Matt , if it was a lie . But it 's the truth , and I ai n't scared to swear it . Give it to me . What do you want me to swear ? You say it . Swear I 'm the only man in the world ever you felt love for . I swear it . I swear it by God . And may the blackest curse of God strike you if you 're lying . And may the blackest curse of God strike me if I 'm lying . Oh , glory be to God , I 'm after believing you now . - Now what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , why ? - Oh , God pity me . Sure , it 's some devil 's treachery in it . You swearing on a Catholic cross , and you one of the others . - Well , do n't you believe me , Matt ? - Oh , but if it ai n't a Catholic you are ... I ai n't nothing , Matt . What 's the difference ? Did n't you hear me swear ? I 'm afraid I love you , God forgive me , no matter what you are . I 'd be going mad if I 'd not be having you . I 'd be killing the world . We 'll be wedded this day . And we 'll be happy , the two of us , in spite of the devil . Well , we got ta have a drink on this , my good man . - Blast you . - That 's the way to talk . Oh , Matt , it 's time for you two to kiss and make up . You 'll be shipmates on the Londonderry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Aye , and I 'm boatswain on her . The devil ! You 'd be shipping away to sea and leaving her alone again , will you ? It 's all right , Matt . That 's where he belongs , and I want him to go . You 've got ta go too . We 'll need the money . And as for me being alone , why , that runs in the family and I 'll get used to it . I 'll get a house somewhere and I 'll make a regular place for you two to come back . And now you 'll drink and be friends , huh ? Sure . - Here 's luck to you . - Skoal . Well , you 'll not be lonesome long . I 'll see to that , God willing . Sure as himself will be having a grandchild riding his foot , I tell you . - Maybe twins . - Oh , quit your kidding . Is it any religion at all you have , you and your Anna ? Well , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? Oh , then I 'm damned entirely . Oh , well , what 's the difference ? It is God 's will anyhow . It 's queer , you and me shipping on same boat that way . That ai n't right . It 's that funny way old devil sea do her worst dirty tricks . Aye , is so . Faith , I 'm afraid you 've the right of it for once , devil take you . Why , gee , Matt , you ai n't agreeing with him , are you ? Come on . Here 's to the sea , no matter what . Be a game sport , man . Drink to that . Fog , fog all time . You ca n't tell where you was going . Only that old devil sea . She knows .

Just for that , he 'll go to bed without his supper . I 'll see about that . Thou shalt have no other gods before me . Thou shalt not make or to be any graven memory .

Did n't I always say you was an artist at heart ? Pa Shelby , stop you talking nonsense and hand me those gadgets . Reach for them . Are you gon na be sentimental all your life ? As far as you 're concerned , I am . This is what I'be been looking for . The star of Bethlehem . Do you know when we got that ? That was the first prize that Isaac ever won in Sunday school . Yes . - Who 's that now ? - Only Johnny . Only Johnny ? Is n't Isabelle with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in , you go . Hello , Isabelle ! Why , Isabelle ... Are you crying ?

Is n't this beautiful ? - You 're taking the last of my children . - And the best . Do n't be so modest , Johnny . Congratulations , Isabelle . Of course , this is a tremendous surprise for everybody . We 've only been expecting this since you were about that high . Isabelle , I wish you both ... the best of everything . Isabelle , you 're getting a mighty fine boy . I know it . Johnny . When do you and Isabelle intend to get married ? Well ... We 'd like to get married as soon as we could . - But probably not until spring anyway . - No , do n't you put it off on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get along alright . About time anyway we stop living off of you . You know that ... government job that was promised to me ? Well , I got tired of waiting for it . I 've lined up something else . Gon na pay me plenty of money too . That 's great ! What is it , Pa ? I do n't want to talk about it yet . I always say : deliver the goods first , talk afterwards . Right ? Right . The happiest moment in a woman 's life is when she feels for the first time her baby 's arms around her neck . No word 's fine enough to describe it ! And the pride and happiness to see him grow up . Whatever you do , do n't let anyone rob you of the happiness of children . - It 's the greatest consolation ... - Here they are , Ma ! Who seeks entrance here ?

Yes , sir , I 'm here to state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family certainly uses nifty judgement . - Stop taking bows . Nobody needs to tell me these boxes are from New York . How is that , Les ? How can you tell ? So easy to take their mind of a tip . No effort at all . Les , would you like to have a little Tom and Jerry ? If it ai n't too little . Now children , I know you 're cold after you arrived . And if you come in here with me , we may find something to warm me up . Of course it ai n't New York , but it 's good . Women and children first ! Ben , he 's just got a natural sense of humour . - I 'm so disappointed Phyllis could n't come . - She sends you her love , Ma . I 'll tell you all about it later . - I have a secret . - What ? What ? Susan , what do you think ? Johnny and Isabelle are engaged to be married . Bring in the eight , Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that ? Johnny and Isabelle are gon na be married . Going to be married ? Come to your big brother ! - Johnny . - Well , you old son of a ... Say , what did I hear about you taking the fatal plunge ? Have n't you seen this ? That tells the story . - You old ... - Thanks for the booze . - They do n't call in that . - You mean you find it out soon enough . Ca n't something be done about this before it 's too late . Everybody makes mistakes , that 's why the train stops at Reno . Do n't say that . It may turn out alright . Pa should have had a circus . His family is full of clowns . You 're wrong , darling , clowns are funny . Hello , everybody ! Hello , Isaac ! - My boy ! - Hello , Ma . - Are we late ? - My Isaac is never late . - Hello , Isaac . - Hello , Susan . - How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hello , Tommy .

You see , I 'm just going down the street a bit . You see , I ... have n't finished my Christmas shopping yet . - How are you fixed for money ? - I 'm alright , I got plenty of it . Now , do n't say anything about it . I 'll keep your secret . Everything is set . Adams will meet us at the grove . - But is it safe ? - Is it safe ? That Acme paint company sign on the side is the best camouflage you can get . Yes , but this ai n't my car . It belongs to the people that Johnny works for . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job .

We will , Ma ! Ma was happy tonight . I wish she would n't try to do so much . When you love someone , you can never do enough . That 's the way I feel about you . That diamond ring is only the beginning , you wait and see . A little house ... and a car . - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnny ? If all my plans work out , we 'll both be sitting on top of the world . Imagine you and me , sitting on top of the world . Star light , star bright . First star I see tonight . I wish I may , I wish I might . Have this wish I wish tonight . - What are you wishing ? - If I tell you , it wo n't come true . On the level , do you like the ring ? Like it ? I 'm as proud as I can be . How about the receipt ? Keep your eyes open and your trap shut . Make it snappy . Listen , Shelby . You turn off the road at Angus ' place , take the short cut to Cedars . And when you get to the garage , go in the back way , Mac will be waiting there for you . - Did you get that ? - Yes . I 'll be in in just a minute , mother dear . I 'll be over for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop you , step on it . Pa ! Johnny ! Johnny , you go on and get out of here . Go on home , go on ! Pa , what are you doing with the truck ? Johnny , I want you to get away from here . I do n't want you to get in any trouble . Now , go on , go on home ! So that 's the job you were talking about , eh ? Are you going to get out of here ? You mind your own business . Go on ! Pa , you ca n't get away with a thing like this . You must be crazy ! Pa , I 'm ashamed of you . This will kill Ma . Now , come on , Pa . Let 's leave the car here and go home . Johnny , we could n't do that . The stuff is here and they 'll trace the car to the house . Now go on . Alright , Pa , I 'll unload the stuff . You go on home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anything to happen to you . - That 's alright , go on home . - I did n't want to do this . - Go on ! - Did you find anything ? - No . Those shots came from the big car . That big car was a decoy , it let the little car get away . - What 's that ? - Wait a minute . Merry Christmas , Ma ! Merry Christmas , children . Did you sleep well ? Great . That smells good . No , you need n't bother at all . Everything 's all ready . Where 's a fellow wash his face around here ? Ben ! I 'll show you where it is , come on . - Have a heart , have a heart ! - You , baby ! There are strawberries for dessert , you 'll find them in the closet . - Good morning , Susan . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas , Thomas . - Did you sleep well ? - Like a top . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , grabbing my books and being off for school . And I wish you were just that little , so I can bundle you all off , give you your lunch pails and send you to school . - What would you think about that ? - That would n't be hard to take . Hurry and wash your face and hands , now breakfast is almost ready . Alright , Ma . What a delightful performance ! That old oaken bucket , that iron-bound bucket , that moss-covered bucket , that hangs , that hangs ... - Merry Christmas , Pa ! - The same to you , Susan . Hurry and get yourself ready for breakfast . Alright , Ma . Isaac and Minnie are coming and bringing the children , so we 're all having breakfast together . Ma , there were n't any more strowberries , so I got raspberries . Is that alright ? - That 's perfectly alright , dear . - It 's cold out here ! Good morning , Pa , and a great big Merry Christmas ! Ben ! Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there until Minnie and Isaac come with the children . I was just trying to see what Santa Claus put in my stocking . Ma , I wish they 'd hurry . Poor Ben is just starving to death . Well , I guess we wo n't wait any longer then . Ma , where 's Johnny ? He was out late last night and he is n't up yet . Johnny , breakfast is ready . We ca n't wait any longer . Now hurry along , son ! Come right along ! Well , Ben , you sit there and ... Susan sits there and ... Thomas ! Thomas ! - Alright , Ma . - Come , sit right here next to me . Come on , Pa ! Pa , will you please say grace ? Our Lord , we give thee ... Just in time , Isaac . - Good morning , Isaac . - Good morning . Pa , I want to speak to you . - What 's Isaac so serious about ? - Something 's happened . I hope it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? - Pa , what is it ? - It 's Johnny . - Johnny ? What 's happened to him ? - He is n't hurt ! - He 's in jail . Jail ? - Isaac , you 're fooling ! - What for ? What did he do ? The police caught him with his car full of liquor . I do n't believe you ! I ca n't believe you ! My Johnny is in his room ! - I 'll show you . - I 'll go , Ma . In the attic bedroom . He 's brought disgrace upon us . Having liquor in your car is no disgrace . It 's only a small fine . It is n't even serious . An officer was shot ! That 's serious , is n't it ? Isaac , no ! My Johnny would n't hurt anyone . - Ma ! Ma ! - Yes ? Ma , he 's not upstairs ! And his bed has n't been slept in . Pa ! Pa ! Did you hear ? Johnny 's been arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something ? - Why do n't you do something ? - Ma ! Ma ! - You 've got to take it easy . - Johnny ! - Tommy , how much money you 've got ? - None , to speak of . It 's gon na take a lot of money to bail him out of a charge like that . - How about you , Isaac ? - Be sure , your sins will find you out . Now , you let us help . Listen , everything 's going to be alright . - She 's fainted . - Give her a glass of water . Are you alright , Ma ? Are you alright ? Ca n't you see ? There is n't anything I can do about it . But Johnny , you 're not trying to do a thing . Why do n't you talk to the lawyer ? - I have n't anything to say to him . - Johnny , you 're shielding someone . - You 're crazy . - I ca n't understand it . Did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay for it , did it ? I 'll take it back . - I 'm sorry about that . - It does n't matter . Sitting on top of the world ... It sounds sort of foolish now , does n't it ? Johnny , I do n't believe you did it ! I wo n't believe it ! They caught me with the goods . There 's no doubt about that . Of course , it would n't have been so bad , only they took the car and do n't belong to me . Fine chance I 'd have with that company now . Or any other company . Listen . Do n't you gamble your future on me . Do n't wait . There 're plenty of other boys in this town with good jobs . They could be crazy about you . I do n't want you to come here again . I do n't want to see you . Johnny . Johnny . Good morning , Pa . Well , they 've done it . They 've convicted him . Three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've got to do something . We 've got to ! We ca n't do anything now . Johnny should have thought of that before he comitted the crime . - We 've got to help him . - He never listened to me . I could n't tell him anything . I always say : " As ye sow , so shall ye reap " . You can keep them old bars . I do n't want them where I 'm going . You keep them old dice too . You all ai n't got enough juice around here . Where they 're gon na take me , they 're gon na make some electricity experiments on me . Hi , young fellow , let 's go . I 'll stay with Ma Shelby . Can I talk to my boy ? Just for a minute . Make it snappy . Johnny . Johnny . Pa , pull yourself together . You ca n't go on like this . I 've got to , it 's killing me . I ca n't eat , I ca n't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for me . - I 'm gon na tell the truth . - Pa , you promised ! You 've got to think of Ma , and the other kids . Come on , Pa . Cheer up ! This little time I 'll be away wo n't mean a thing . I 'll be back before you know it . Johnny . Pa , does the noise of the machine bother you ? No , Ma ... no . Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Here I am . You had a nice , long sleep . Where is Ma ? She 's gone to visit Johnny . She should be back soon . I 've heard the train coming just a little while ago . Isabelle , you do n't believe Johnny is guilty , do you ? I know he is n't . You 'll always love him , stand by him , wo n't you ? Always . Isabelle , tell Ma ... When she comes ... I want to see her . Something I 've ... got to tell her . Yes , dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be hungry . You 're alright . Ma Shelby , you must have walked very fast . Isabelle , I have so much to tell you . - How is Johnny ? - Honestly , that boy gets better looking everytime I see him . Did he ask you about me ? Well , now , let me see ... - I think he said something ... - Ma Shelby , tell me . He sends you ... - How is Pa ? - He had a long rest . He 's asked about you several times . He wants to see you . And I have so much to tell him all about Johnny . Pa ! Isabelle ! I manage to keep busy . Sometimes it 's awfully hard to realize that Pa 's gone . Poor Pa . The only luck he ever had ... was bad . He was so good and kind . If I had my life to live over , I 'd marry the same dear man . Of course you would . Ma , why do n't you go and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I could n't bring myself to give up the old home . I do n't mind working , I like it . Besides , it 's good for me . You 're swell . How is Isabelle ? That girl is prettier everyday I see her . Do you know she and her Ma beg me to come to live with them till you come home ? Why do n't you ? I could n't do that . As much as I love them ... - Johnny ? - The kid himself . - How did you get out so soon ? - Good behaviour . Why did n't you let me know ? I 'd have waited at jail all night . That 's just why I did n't let you know . Besides , I thought it would be kind of nice to surprise you . Where are you going , Ma ? I must tell Isabelle , she 'd never forgive me . Come here ! I telephoned her , she knows I 'm home . Let me set this pillow for you . Ma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Can I get you another cup of coffee ? - I 'm full right up to here . I 've never eaten so much in my life . I was so hungry I thought I had hollow legs . Johnny , I have n't laughed so since ... That sounds sort of encouraging . Wait a minute , sweetheart . Here , take it easy . What 's the matter , honey ? Did I say something ? - Of course not , Johnny . - But you 're crying . I ca n't help it . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . Johnny , you have n't changed a bit . - No fooling ? - No fooling . You know , now stop me if I 'm wrong , but I 've got a hunch that you two are sort of glad to see me . Now once more . I must fix your room . Wait a minute , Ma . You ca n't run out on us like that . Can she , Isabelle ? - I should say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you two must have a lot to talk about . Johnny , I left the rest of that apple pie in the cupboard . In case ! Really I ought to be going home . Isabelle , ca n't you stay all night ? Would your Ma care ? - I told her that I might . - Why do n't you say that in the first place ? - Do n't ask so many questions . - Come here . Now that 's all settled . I want you to listen to a little straight talk . Johnny , you home ! Listen , honey , I 've got some great plans . I 've been promised a job out in Seattle , and my railroad fare too . Looks like a great chance . It wo n't be any time at all before I 'll be able to send for you and Ma . - Johnny , why your mother ... - I know . That 's the tough part of it . I do n't know how to tell her . - Why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere else , start over . When I got off the train and walked up the street , everybody looked the other way . Fellows I used to go to school with ducked in the stores , so they would n't have to meet me . And when I came to the gate , some kids hollered " Jailbird " . Johnny , you must n't go . Do n't you see ? I ca n't stay here . I 'm no millionaire . And my own family , think about . Ma 's getting old , Isaac . That 's the tough part of it . Of course , I have n't made things any too easy for her . You have n't made the things too easy for any of us . It 's been like a black cloud hanging over the whole family . I know that . As soon as I get out there , I 'll send money for her every month . I 'll send it to you , Isaac , so that you can see that she gets the things she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the money . Answer the door for me , will you , honey ? No , you answer it yourself . My mother . The great event , it shall come to pass . - How do you do ? - Phyllis . Phyllis , darling , come here . Mother , this is Phyllis . How do you do ? - Is n't this a surprise ? - Yes . - Mother , take off your things . - You do . Come in here . Why did n't you let us know you were coming ? We 'd have met you at the train . Isaac thought it would be nice to surprise you . Isaac 's been so worried about me , he thought it 's best to close up the old home . What ? - He said it was so expensive . - Did he say that ? Well , it was awfully lonesome living there all alone . But he took all our furniture to his home to keep for us . Gosh , it 's good to see you , Ma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a home here with us just as long as you want it . Then , you go upstairs , to my place . All right . Goodbye . This is gon na be a full page ad for the world 's greatest washing machine . You know , the old method in contrast with the new . I never thought I 'd stoop to this kind of work . It costs money to live in New York . All right , you can rest now , Ma . Answer the phone , will you , Ma ? Hello ? Just a moment , I 'll see . - It 's for Phyllis . - Call her , will you , Ma ? She 's up in the roof with some girlfriends taking a sunbath . I 'll call her . She would n't allow me up there . She says I 'm too young . Phyllis ! Phyllis ! - What do you want ? - You 're wanted on the telephone . How did you know I was over there ? Thomas told me you were up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't fool me , not for a minute . I 'm on to you . Why , Phyllis ... I would n't ... You think I 've done something wrong . Now , I suppose you think I 've done something I should n't do , do n't you ? Well , I have n't . I 'll show you where you get off . I wo n't be spied upon by you or anybody else . I wo n't stand for it . - You 're snooping , you 're always snooping . - No , Phyllis , I was n't . I know you want to cause trouble for me when you came here . - Well , you wo n't cause any more ! - Phyllis ! I do n't care if you are his mother . He 'll have to choose between you and me . If he wants you , all right , but he ca n't have us both . It 's all right , Thomas , I do n't mind at all . This is Phyllis 's home and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young I felt just the same as she . Relatives are a nuisance . I feel terrible about this , Ma . No , Thomas , do n't you worry at all . There 's so much work for me to do with Susan . And I know Susan and Ben are anxious for me to visit them . - But are you sure you 'll be all right ? - Of course I will , dear . - But she 's my mother , Ben . - I know , but we ca n't do it . Why do you think we moved to this little apartment ? ' Cos we had to . We 're losing money in the shop everyday . People are n't eating meat like they used to . Some of them go on a diet and do n't eat meat at all . If this keeps up , I 'll go broke . I 've already had to fire the delivery boy . - She 's willing to work . - She 's too old to deliver meat . Where am I if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old woman like her . I like your Ma and I do n't wan na be mean about it , but we 've got to be sensible . Later on , if things break , business picks up , OK , gladly . - But ... where can she go , Ben ? - To Isaac 's . He 's got a big house , no trouble for him . Why should he pass the buck to us ? You let me handle it , I wo n't hurt her feelings . Give me that ! Pa , tell Isaac to give me the bike ! Junior ! Harry ! Pa ! Junior ! Now let her ride , let her ride . Let 's go of her hair , stop ! I 'm gon na take that bicycle away from both of you . We 're not gon na have any more of that foolishness . Get in there . Get in there ! I 'm tired and sick of it . That 's all ! The Lord said " Let there be peace " and I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Dear Ma , " ... " Your bad boy , Johnny " . Isaac ! Yes , Minnie ? Isaac , look out the window . There she is . I told you she 'd be back . - It 's always nice to get home , dear . - Yes , it is . I tell you we have n't got room for her . You know my sister Rose is coming on to help me put up my pickles in preserve . Ma can help you , she 's willing to work . But you promised Rose she could come . She 'll have to wait , it ca n't be helped . Besides , I like Ma 's preserves better . But she 's in the way . I wo n't have her , she makes me nervous . She 's going to stay , that 's all there is to it . She 's going to stay , is she ? Did n't hear of anything from Johnny lately ? Shut up , you ! My back 's against the wall , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are you , grandma ! Where have you been ? - Isaac ! - Where have you been ? I 've been to uncle Ben 's and aunt Susan 's house . How long are you going to stay , grandma ? - How long are you going to stay ? - I think I 'll stay a long , long time , dear . - What did you get for us ? - What did I get for you ? Let 's see if I bring something for you . - What is it ? - They 're drops . The whole party is lost . Even the firm he works for have given up hope . That 's all there is to it . That means she 'll be on our hands for the rest of her life . Well , I wo n't stand it ! You promised my sister Rose she could come . Where are we gon na put her ? You do n't expect me to throw my mother in the street , do you ? Well , there are places she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where . - At Isabelle 's and her mother . Isabelle just begged her to come to live with them . Would she do it ? No , she has too much pride ! I might have been able to talk to her into it . Isabelle 's aunt 's died and they 've gone there . Her and her pride ! Well , I 'm sick of her ! There are a lot of old people at the County Poor House . You 're a tax payer , you can get her in . She 'll be a lot better off there than anywhere else . I 'm entitled to some consideration , I work like a dog in this house . Will you stop nagging ! Where 's Ma ? Sitting up there by that window waiting for her darling Johnny to come home . Enjoying the sunshine , Ma ? Yes , it 's a nice day , is n't it ? Sunshine . Fresh air . Flowers , breeze . The best things in life are free . That 's true . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed the poor farm . I was surprised . How attractive it is . And how peaceful and contented the old folks looked . It 's a blessing for those alone in the world . I was thinking ... I bet you 'd like it . The change will do you good . It 'll only be a little time till Johnny comes home . - He 's not coming home . - How can you say that ? He 's no good , that 's what I say and ... Ma , I think you 'd better go . Isaac . It 's Minnie . Ma , Minnie is funny . She 's funny , she 's peculiar . I 'll ... do whatever you think is best . - Condition of health ? - Very well , thank you . Cause of attendance ? I do n't think I understand . Why did you come here ? No one was really to blame , but I did n't have any other place to go . I see . All right . You 'll come with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evil ... - Isaac ! Johnny ! He 's here ! He 's coming down the street . - Johnny ? - I tell you I saw him ! That 's him . - Johnny ! - Hello , Minnie . - Isaac ! - Johnny , this is a surprise . - Where is Ma ? Is n't she here ? - Did n't you hear about it ? Hear about it ? Hear about what ?

Can you arrange so that my arrest wo n't frighten her ? - I 'll try . - Thanks . - Any papers on you ? - No , I 'm not scouting this trip , Colonel . I came home to bury my dead ... and take my little girl to Richmond , where my sister is . I see . Well , come on . Let 's get it over with . I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to- to bid my little girl good-bye . I understand . Will you tell her I 've gone back to General Lee ? I 'll return soon . - Yes , it would just about fit . - What ? - The Yankee uniform . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Well . I left a uniform there to be mended by the slaves . If you stole that uniform , I do n't know how I could stop you . - You mean-- If you were wearing a Union uniform ... and had a pass through the lines ... you 'd stand a mighty good chance of making Richmond . - Where would I get a pass ? - From me . I do n't think my country expects me to make war on babies . I do n't know what to say . Of course , you realize what it means if you 're caught in my uniform . Are n't you taking an awful chance yourself , Colonel ? War 's full of chances . I wo n't forget this . I hope you get through . - God bless you . - There 's just one thing I ask . In passing through our lines , whatever you see or hear , forget . My word of honor . Daddy , Daddy ! The soldiers are coming back ! Get out the back way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Yankee man gon na be nice ? A man could n't be nicer than he 's been .

Good-bye , Uncle Billy . - Any sign of him ? - Not a thing , Colonel . Well , you men better come in and warm up . There 's a fire in here . Yes , sir . - No trace at all , eh ? - No . But I 'm sure he 's still around here . They buried his wife just an hour ago . Look ! There goes somebody . - A man and a child ? - Yes . They 're headed for the woods . That 's a slave and his pickaninny . They just left here . They 're all right . - Do you hear anything ? - Horses . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man give you a paper to show them , Daddy ? Yes , but the Yanks around here may recognize me . I do n't want to use the pass until we get out of this neighborhood . This is n't a good neighborhood anyway . No .

Have you got a little girl , mister ? No , I 've got a boy . - Where 'd you come from ? - Cary 's plantation . Left there at noon . - Why are n't you using the main road ? - Full of artillery . How old is your little boy ? - Five . - Oh , I 'm six . - My boy 's bigger than you . - He is ? Yes . This looks all right , but I do n't know .

I do n't know why it is n't a sin to do any of the things we do in war . What 's the 72nd Vermont ? Well , that 's a regiment of soldiers I have no intention of meeting . Halt ! Colonel Morrison asked me to take this child to Greensburg . - Here 's his pass . - Colonel Morrison ? - Yes . - Where was he ? Cary plantation , about 1 8 miles south of_here . - When did you leave there ? - Why-- We left there at 1 2:00 . - Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I 'm six years old .

Do n't you remember the shoe polish ? - No ! - Well , I do . Her old man 's the most dangerous scout in the rebel army . This looks mighty funny to me . Go get ' em ! Hurry up ! Head ' em off ! Take the lower road ! Get under the seat quick , honey . Halt ! Keep your hands up . Are you armed ? - No . - Let 's see . All right , we 'll go back .

That child has literally captured us all . - Colonel-- Yes , I know . I heard you . No chance at all , eh ? No . And is my little party set for the morning of the 27 th too ? I 'm sorry , Colonel . He 's innocent , Major . All he did was try to help a child . The evidence we could n't overcome , Colonel ... was the fact that you not only gave him a pass but that he was wearing your uniform . - I stole that uniform . - We could n't make them believe that .

Well , the world is full of names . They could have picked out any other name . - Who could ? - Whoever did . - I do n't know who it was . - Man , what are you talkin ' about ?

Thank you kindly , sir . Tell me about it . My daddy went away to the war ... and then the Yankees came around to our house ... and sometimes my daddy came home . - Was he in uniform ? - Yes , sir . - What color ? - Gray . I see .

That 's all . So Uncle Billy went and brought my daddy back home . The next day , my mommy went away . There , there . Do n't cry . You 're a great big girl . You must n't cry . - I won't . - What happened next ? Then the Yankees came , and my daddy had to hide in the garret . Then Colonel Morrison came in . He talked to me . He 's awfully nice .

No , sir . He told me that if we got to Richmond ... and anyone asked me what I had seen ... I was in honor bound not to tell them . - He told you that ? - Yes , sir . Because Colonel Morrison asked him not to see anything ... and my daddy gave his word , and they shook hands . - John . - Yes , Mr . President ? - Mr . President ? - Yes , Miss Virgie .

Uh , check on passengers at gangplank reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person we bump into may be the murderer ... - sort of gives a fellow the creeps . - [Chuckles] What 'll be your next move , Mr . Chan ? Make effort to catch murderer . - For you , sir . - Well . Will you pardon me ? Listen to this ! " Do n't enter Avalanche in the Santa Juanita Handicap . A dead horse ca n't win a race . " - May I see that ? - Where 'd you get this , [Bruce] ? What ? Oh , at the- at the desk . Time of delivery stamped on back of envelope ? Yes , it seems to be blurred . Four minutes past 6:00 . That 's only 10 minutes ago . - Uh , may examine , please ? - First they get the major . Now they 're trying to scare me . Look here , George . Whoever wrote this means business ... and Avalanche is too fine a horse to lose through your stubbornness . I 'll give you 20,000 for him and retire him for a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the major was right . I 'm going to see it through to the finish . I 'll talk to [Captain] Blake and insist on an extra guard below . Most excellent precaution . Oh . So sorry . May have letter , please ? - Certainly . - Thank you so much . [Ship's_Whistle_Blows] Oh , gee , Pop . How 'd you know it was me ? Frequent spanking when young make rear view very familiar . Why you here ? Well , after you left , Mom decided to take the kids to visit Aunt Ling ... at the other end of the island , and I thought-Uh , you make suggestion about visit ? I - I sort of mentioned it . But , uh-Cabin boy outfit- disguise ? Oh , no , Pop . This is on the level . I signed for the trip . Now look , Pop , if a gambling ring 's back of this , it 's dangerous ... and , well , gee , I 'd feel terrible if anything happened to you ... and I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is poor who have worthy son . " Thank you so much . Then you 'll let me help ? Examine , please . [Whistles] Say ! The top edge is uneven , like it had been cut off with scissors . Yes . Writer take precaution to eliminate Oceanic trademark ... but forget watermark in paper . They 're the same , all right . Then whoever wrote this is on the boat . And look , Pop . The E 's are clogged up , and the R 's a little above the line . That means if we can find the machine this was written on , we 'll have our man . Why , it 's a cinch ! I can search all the cabins . One moment , please . Search only in pursuit of duty as cabin boy . Must remember obligation to ship . Okay , Pop . I 'll clean every room on the boat if I have to . One thing more . As , uh , humble cabin boy , must forget , " Okay , Pop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secretary . I 'm gon na bet every dollar I have on Avalanche . - Then we 'll get married and-- [Bruce] , please . That is n't the kind of marriage I want . I 'd always hoped the man I 'd marry would stay away from racing and betting . - Why , Alice , I never thought that you-- Do n't you see , darling ? That 's the sort of thing I 've had all my life . Dad and I never had a real home . It was always just one track after another . But the thrill of racing- the gamble and then winning . And losing . We never felt sure of anything . One minute Dad would be on top of the world ... and the next , we 'd have to borrow money to pay the feed bill . [Bruce] , dear , I 'd hate to go through that with you . All right , dear . Santa Juanita will be the last time . I promise . Beg pardon , sir . The gentleman in 219 wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , darling . I 'll see you in the lounge . [Locking_Door] - [With_Accent] Oh ! So " solly . " - Hear , hear . Not so fast . - You 're a new boy , are n't you ? - New now . " Velly " soon old . Ah , smart , eh ? You do n't belong up here . - And what were you doing in that cabin ? - Finish downstair . Think " velly " smart work hard . By and by " catchee " more money . Yeah ? You 'll catch more than that if I find you up here again . Now , scat ! Scat chop-chop . Typing , Faint - What are you doing here ? - Oh ! Oh . [With_Accent] Excuse , please . Write letter to girlfriend . Hereafter , write your letters somewhere else . So " solly " you mad . Clean up now , chop-chop . So " solly . " So " solly . " So " solly . " - Oh , so " solly . " - Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to stay off this deck . Oh , tell him I went bottom side , Pop . I 'm awfully sorry , sir . Did I hurt you ? [Sighs] Stoop to pick up pin . Bring good luck . Good luck to that moon-faced cabin boy . He 's a very suspicious character , he is . And as soon as I get me hands on him , into the brig he goes . Did you notice which way he went , sir ? Uh , make hasty exit to north . Right you are , sir . I 'll get him . Psst ! Pop ! I found the typewriter all right . It belongs to Mr . Fenton . See ? The letters are exactly the same . Most excellent progress . Well , I guess that 's that . All we 've got to do now is arrest him . Hasty conclusion like toy balloon- Easy blow up , easy pop . Do n't you think Fenton did it ? You find way to typing machine . Maybe someone else do same . Gee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do now , Pop ? Surprise attack often find enemy unprepared . That extra guard ought to be on duty by now . I 'll step down and check . - I wish you wouldn't . - Now , dear , will you please stop worrying ? I 've done nothing but worry , George , ever since you received that note . - I told you not to say anything about it . - I know . I know . You stay here with Warren . I 'll be gone only a few minutes . Ca n't you persuade him to sell Avalanche to you ? Try and make him do it . Any progress ? Long road sometime shortest way to end of journey . - Uh , may borrow cigarette , please ? - Yes , certainly . This was n't in my pocket when we left the dining room . It 's another one of those notes . " A dead horse is n't worth $20,000 . " What does it all mean ? It means that someone knows an awful lot about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Thank you so much . Will make immediate investigation . Did you notice the way he looked at me ? Do you think he could have put that in your pocket ? No , he was n't within a yard of me . The best place for you is in your stateroom . I 'm going down to the stalls and see George right away . [Coughs] - Left at the post ? - [Bruce] 'll be back in a minute . - Alone at last . - Now , Denny , do n't tell me I 'm the only girl you ever loved . If [Bruce] does n't marry you pretty soon , I will tell you . - What 's holding things up ? - Money . He 's so noble . He insists upon waiting ... until he can support me in the manner to which I 've been accustomed . - Very foolish young man . - You mean [Bruce] ? Foolish to seek fortune when real treasure hiding under nose . [Laughs] Will you tell him that for me ? Will be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let a pal down ... you tell [Bruce] to consult me hereafter before he bets on a horse . [Chuckles] Oh , wo n't you sit down , Mr . Chan ? Thank you so much . The same in these , and make mine Scotch . - Yes , sir . - What will you have ? - Uh , sarsaparilla . - Sarsaparilla , sir ? - Please . - Very good , sir . That 's dissipation for you . You are lucky at , uh , horse betting ? I 'll say he is . With all the odds against him ... he bet on Stardust at the Melbourne Cup . - I have good hunches sometimes . - Play hunch on Stardust ? I suppose you could call it that . Look , Mr . Chan . Just as I was coming up the stairs , this fell at my feet . " It 's dangerous to know too much about other people 's business . " - [Bruce] . - Do n't get the jitters . That sounds like the one George received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Bruce] told me about it . Well , what do you make of it , Mr . Chan ? Make conclusion you talk too much . - Well , this is for you , Mr . Barton . - Hmm ? How it came to be on my tray I do n't know . It was not there when I left the bar . Well , I got one too . - They certainly are n't playing any favorites . - [Opens_Envelope] " A smart gambler knows a dead horse ca n't win . " Very interesting . May keep , please ? Will make immediate investigation . I 'd like to do a little investigating on my own hook , if you do n't mind . Cooperation greatly appreciated . Excuse , please . Well , hello , Mr . Chan . Well , this seems to be for me . Yes . " Withdraw Avalanche from the Santa Juanita Handicap . This is your last warning . " - Your secretary and Mr . Barton also receive mysterious notes . - What ? Uh , writer seem very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? Why do n't you do something about it ? Rabbit run very fast , but sometime turtle win race . Well , they 're after you too . [Chester] What does it say ? Most distressing . Must give immediate attention . Excuse , please . Come back here , you ! @door_opens , Closes Gee , Pop . That steward nearly grabbed me dropping that last note to Mr . [Chester] . Congratulations for most expert delivery of mysterious letters . Did your scheme work all right ? Did you find anything ? Experiment result in most interesting discovery . [Ship_Whistle_Blows] [Man] Trouble in the forward hold ! The forwards stalls . That 's where Avalanche is . Come on , Pop . One moment , please . You remain here . - [Whinnying] - Come on . Get these horses out of here . [All_Shouting] [Shouting_Continues] [Whinnying] - What started this , [Captain] ? - I 'm sure I do n't know , but it 's under control . It 's okay . It 's a lucky thing the fire was discovered in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... - just to carry out a threat against a horse . - Contradiction , please . Person who start fire intend no harm to noble animal . How do you figure that out ? Fire made directly under automatic apparatus ... so heat will set off alarm more quickly before much damage . Their way of letting me know that they could have killed Avalanche if they 'd wanted to . - Where was the extra guard when this happened ? - He was on duty . - May , uh , question him ? - Smithers ! - Yes , sir ? - You were where when alarm sounded ? On the cargo deck , sir . You had instructions to stay in here . Why did you leave ? One of the booms was squeaking , sir , and made Avalanche nervous . When Mr . [Chester] came down , he spoke to Mr . Bagley about it ... - and he told me to fix it . - That 's right . [Captain] Smithers . You also on cargo deck ? No . After Mr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long there before alarm ? About 10 minutes , maybe 15 . I do n't know exactly . - Horses alone then ? - Streamline was here . I told him to keep an eye on them till Smithers got back . Mr . Streamline ? Yes , sir ? - Yes , sir ? - You were present when alarm sounded ? Yes , sir , but- but I was asleep , sir . You see , sir , I took me a drink of gin for the misery in my feet ... and , naturally , I go to sleep when I take a drink of gin . I ought to discharge you ! Next move may be more than warning . - Extreme precaution now necessary . - You 're absolutely right . - From now on , you sleep here , Bagley . You understand ? - That 's a good idea , I guess . - You have your gun with you ? - It 's in my room . [Chester] Well , what good is it doing there ? I thought with this going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I thought with this going on , something might happen , so I was cleaning it . It 's on my table , Streamline . Get it for me , will you ? - It ai n't loaded , is it ? - Of course not . And bring the cartridges . Yes , sir . Excuse , please . What did you find , Mr . Chan ? Ghost of matches . Here are the gun and bullets , Mr . [Chester] . If you ever take another drink on duty , you 're [Man] What happened ? - Mr . Chan ! - What happened , [Captain] ? - Get a doctor . Hurry ! - [Sailor] Yes , sir . - I 'm sorry , Mr . Chan . I do n't know what to say . Happy bullet in leg rather than heart . Thank you so much . I thought you were cleaning the gun . You said it was n't loaded . It was n't when I left my room . - Ten minutes so far . - Hmm . [Knocking] You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May enter . Hello . I hear you ran into a bullet . Contradiction , please . Bullet ran into me . [Chuckles] I 'm so sorry . Really , I am . Sympathy reason for visit ? And to return the mysterious little note that you sent me . Clever idea , Mr . Chan . My compliments . Pleasure to return compliment . Clever deduction . Good . And now that you 've admitted my ability as a detective ... why not let me in on the secret ? - Whom did you expect to catch ? - Maybe you have answer . I wish I had . I liked the old major a great deal . [Nervous_Chuckle] If I can be of any service , just , uh , give me a buzz . - Thank you so much . - [Door_Closes] Do you think he did it , Pop ? Ocean have many fish . There it goes . [Man] who set fire have 12 minutes to cover trail . That 's right . Now look , Pop ... Bagley said he was in his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done it , and so could Mr . [Chester] ... because he was there while the guard was outside . But wait a minute ! It might have been that secretary of his too . Because when I dropped his note , he was coming up from the cargo deck . You know ... I still think that Fenton 's the guy we want . I could have sworn someone was at that window . [Lee] , come back . Gee , Pop , what are you always stopping me for ? Why do n't you give me a chance to clean this case up ? Foolish rooster who stick head in lawn mower end in stew . Look at you , laid up for the rest of the trip with a bullet in your leg . I 'm not gon na let them get away with that . I 'm gon na find the guy that loaded that gun ! Oh , so it 's you , eh ? What 's he doing here , sir ? Is he annoying you ? - Very desperate character . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? [Both_Speaking_Chinese] Confine to brig , please . Eagle eye for rest of voyage bring reward . Right you are , sir . I 'll stick to him like Scotch glue . [Chinese] - [Sighs] - [Door_Closes] Thank you so much . [Ship's_Horn_Sounding] Move in there and get a close-up . A little closer , Mr . Bagley . Mind keeping his head up ? Thanks a lot . All right , hold it . - Thanks a lot , Mr . [Chester] . Thanks , Mr . Chan . - Okay . - Hello , Mr . [Chester] . - Hello , boy . How are you ? - Feeling pretty fine , sir . My leg 's almost as good as new . - Well , I 'm glad to hear it . Say , I 'm sorry you lost that race in Melbourne . I 'll bet it never would have happened if I 'd been riding him . That 's all part of the game , boy . Oh , I 'm sorry . This is Eddie Brill , the boy that used to ride for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chan . - Oh , I 've heard a lot about you , Mr . Chan . So pleased . What about these threats you received on the boat , Mr . [Chester] ? Avalanche will be under guard day and night , and no one else will be allowed near him . And I promise you that he will run in the handicap , wo n't you , boy ? - All right . Take him out to the trailer , Bagley . - How about you , Mr . Fenton ? Any of those new horses you bought over there show any promise ? Yes , Gallant Lad . I plan on entering him in the handicap Saturday . Well , what do you think of his chances ? Well , until the winner crosses the finish line ... it 's anybody 's money , is n't that right , [Chester] ? - That 's what makes horse racing . - [Animal_Screeching] - [Horse_Stomping] - [Man] Get down from there ! - Whoa ! Whoa , Gallant Lad ! - [Monkey_Screeching] Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lollipop ! Where you all goin ' ? - Confound that monkey ! Streamline ! - Yes , sir ? Get that monkey down from there before he gets Avalanche crazy too . Here , Mr . Fenton . - Hurry up . Get him off of there . - Yes , sir . Behave yourself . You 're the " fickliest " fool I ever did see . Why do n't you like your friend Gallant Lad no more ? Come on . Get going . Get out of here . Something very strange . What , Pop ? Before fire , monkey dislike Avalanche . Now dislike Gallant Lad . Say , that is funny . Not if horses switched . By golly , I bet that 's it . They could get away with it too . The horses look enough alike , and they 're the same build . What you gon na do ? Go to hotel , take nap . Hiya , Bagley . I thought you were in Australia . - Yeah , I know you did . What 's the new racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That horse you just put in the trailer ai n't Avalanche . That 's Gallant Lad . - Aw , you 're crazy . - Yeah ? You can fool [Chester] . He 's half blind anyway . But I ai n't . That fire was started on the boat to cover the switch . Not so loud . What 's the idea puttin ' an unknown palooka in Avalanche 's place ? - I ca n't answer that here . - Okay , where ? Come along with me . We could n't make a dime betting on Avalanche . He 's the favorite . The best we could get is even money . Sure , and nobody 's seen Avalanche in America . On the boat , the switch is made , and now Avalanche , in disguise ... goes to the post a horse no one ever heard of . Comes in a long shot with big odds . Catch on ? We 're plastering the country with bets from coast to coast at 20-to-1 , and we 'll clean up . Boy , that 's swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aw , you 're already in . Well , boys , we 've got a lot of work to do . Lefty , take Collins and get him planted somewhere where he can hide out and get a good rest . Oh , sure . I know just the spot . - Have a drink ? - Never touch it . - Need any money ? - Well , yeah , I could use some . Took almost all I had gettin ' away from Melbourne . Well , here 's a couple of hundred for you . Thanks , Bagley . I guess I had you figured all wrong . - That 's all right . - Let 's go , Collins . So long , fellas . Good-bye , Collins . Observe anything unusual during night ? Not a thing . There 's no one around this track who does n't belong here . Avalanche is guarded so closely , no one could get within a mile of him . Innocent grass may conceal snake . Not when you go through it with a fine comb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse a workout first . Well , if I can be of any further service , Mr . Chan- [Chuckles] Grateful for all kindness , [Captain] Wade . That 's all right . 1:38 and four-fifths . Not bad . Well , he 'll have to do better than that if he 's going to beat my horse . Mr . [Chester] , they 're bringing Avalanche out now . Can I ride him ? - [Chester] I would n't take a chance , Eddie . - Aw , but I can handle him , sir . - Honest , I can . I 've been able to ride for months now . - Some other time . Whoa , Avalanche ! Whoa ! Steady , boy ! Steady ! [Man] Hold him ! Hold him ! What 's the matter with that horse ? What 's the matter with that boy ? Why does n't he pull him up ? - [Man] Look out . Look out . Be careful there . - Come on now , boy . Hold him up . They 're gettin ' him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go over there . Dad , our horse made better time than that yesterday . What do you suppose is wrong ? - I told the boy to hold him back . - What for ? [Chester] Because I do n't want to advertise what we 've got . The odds will go down . - That 's a secret . - Uh-oh . Oh . [Chuckles] Interesting contraption , is n't it , Mr . Chan ? Excuse ignorance . May inquire nature of strange device ? Oh , that 's part of the latest system for timing the races . Uh , may explain , please ? Well , there 's a lamp in here . This directs a beam of light across the track ... to that little box on the other side which contains a photoelectric cell . The moment a horse passes through this beam , the cell operates ... and a picture of the finish of the race is taken up there ... in the camera-eye booth . Is possible to see , please ? Certainly . Come right along . - Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ? I want you to meet Mr . Chan , Mr . [Charlie] Chan . - Oh , uh , glad to know you . - Thank you so much . Have you got time to explain the system , Al ? Mr . Chan is interested . Oh , sure , sure . Now to begin with , uh ... here 's the diagram of the track . At every quarter mile there 's a photoelectric cell . [Charlie] Mr . Barton already explained . - Shoot beam of light across track to time horses . - That 's right . - Say , Avalanche is just about to break . - Good . I 'll turn this on and show you how it works . Now , this light was automatically turned on when he went through the first beam . It also started the timer across the track . He 's coming to the first quarter . Now watch this light . - Twenty-three flat at the first quarter . - Avalanche is sure in form . Now , if you stand there beside the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track ... you 'll see that they point directly over the finish line ready to take a picture . This switch turns on the high-speed movie cameras ... and we 're now ready to take a picture of the finish . Here he comes . He 's over . And now the film we just took is being developed in this high-speed developer . In less than two minutes ' time , Mr . Chan ... we have taken an actual picture of the finish and sent it down to the judges ' stand . That 's all there is to it . Perfection of mechanical brain make [Charlie] Chan very humble . Thank you so much . Avalanche appears strangely excited . Excuse , please . Pop , I 've got it . I 've got it ! One moment , please . You disobey instructions to remain here in room . I was n't helping any by staying here , so-So you visit racetrack stables . Gee , Pop , how 'd you know ? Hay do not grow in hotel . [Man] who flirt with dynamite sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na let you take all the chances . Look , I got in the stable , and when the guard stepped outside for a smoke ... I took some pieces of cotton and some cleaning solution too . Reveal black dye on forehead of Gallant Lad ... and then white dye on forehead of Avalanche ? Yeah , and there 's the proof . But if they 've been switched , how did Gallant Lad ... come within one second of Avalanche 's fastest time this morning ? [Lee] There 's a screw loose somewhere . Maybe loose screw here in test tube . Did you find something , Pop ? Managed to secure foam from mouth of excited Avalanche ... after practice race this morning . Observe . Bubbles prove foam contain very powerful stimulant for heart . Today make masquerader run very fast to give appearance of champion . I 've got it , Pop . It 's [Chester] and Fenton in cahoot to cheat the public . Also possible gambling ring cahooting to cheat [Chester] and Fenton . Yeah , but Pop , what are we doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's murderer . Roots of tree lead in many directions . Aw , gee , Pop , when are we gon na arrest somebody ? Are you all right , Pop ? Quite all right . Careful , now . [Man] with gun like lightning ... never strike twice in same place . It 's sure lucky that curtain went haywire . Correction , please . Use string . So . Arranged simple device to give warning . Observe . When window raised , string trips shade and releases same . - Safe now to sleep . - Sleep ? We 've got to do something to stop those birds . - Have idea to trap birds . - Okay , Pop . Let 's have it . In morning , you rent [Chinese] laundry wagon . Disguise self as [Chinese] laundry boy . Good night . [Door_Closes] [Shouting_In_Chinese] But that [Chinese] dick is wise to the whole thing . Oh , do n't get excited . I know every move Chan 's made since he left the track this afternoon . Suppose he phones the cops , tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . The line to his room 's been tapped , and Joe 's listening to every call that goes in or out . Suppose you let me handle Chan . Did you get that timing head finished ? Yeah , and , boy , it works like a charm . Come on . I wan na show you . Now , just before the handicap , I replace the timing head at the three-quarter pole ... with this phony and load it with this . So if any other horse is ahead of Gallant Lad , we got nothing to worry about . All right , here we go . Lefty , you pull him through . That ought to stop him . Sure there wo n't be any slipup ? Nah , this is n't gon na be operated from any camera-eye booth . I 'm gon na handle it myself . Well , what 's happened , Mr . [Chester] ? Another threat left at my hotel . Listen . " This is your last chance . Withdraw Avalanche before it 's too late . " Lansing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my horse in this race ... - and I demand protection for him . - And he 'll get it . The Association has something at stake too- the confidence of 80,000 people out there ... who depend on us to protect them from racketeers . Wade , get hold of every available man . Station them around the track and near the stables . - Detail two to guard Mr . [Chester] . - Yes , sir . - Mr . Chan been around ? - I have n't seen him . - Phone him . Tell him to get here fast as he can . - Yes , sir . Let 's go to the stables . Have assurance of immediate departure . Thank you so much . How do I look , Pop ? What 's the matter ? Something happened ? Mr . [Chester] receive another threatening letter . I 've been thinking this over , Pop , and I 'll bet you that Barton guy-Useless talk like boat without oar . Get no place . - Have firecrackers ? - Oh , you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . Come quick . Keep moving and not a word out of either one of you . Get going . Philadelphia can handle two grand on Gallant Lad at 18-to-1 . - Take it . - Place two grand . Hello , Chicago . What are the odds on Gallant Lad ? Let me know when they 're 20-to-1 . San Francisco reporting Gallant Lad at 20-to-1 . - Grab it . - Place 10 grand . Hello , Cincinnati , how much can you handle ? Five grand . Oh , so you got him , huh ? - What 'll we do with him ? - In there . We 'll take care of him later . Come on . Better put ' em in there . I 'll take care of_'em . Clever [Chinese] , huh ? Stuck your snoot in the wrong racket this time , did n't you ? [Speaking_Chinese] - Hey , what 'd he say ? - He say you 're right . Sit down . Chuck , turn on the radio . [Announcer] Here 's a news flash that has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the veins of 80,000 people . We have just learned that another threat has been made against Avalanche . But the owner of today 's favorite ... in spite of the danger to himself and his horse , refuses to withdraw his entry . And here 's more news , ladies and gentlemen , just received . The Chesterjockey backs out in the face of danger . Avalanche is now without a rider . I 'm sorry , Mr . [Chester] , but I do n't want to take the chance .

If I put one of the other boys on Gallant Lad , will you ride Avalanche ? - No , thanks . - That 's very decent of you , Warren . - Oh , forget it . - I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll ride him for you . Please let me . All right , Eddie . You win this race for me ... you 'll find $10,000 in your pocket for that specialist you 've been wanting to see . Oh , gee , Mr .

[On_Radio] Eddie Brill- And who does n't remember Eddie ... when he won the handicap two years ago ? Eddie is going to ride the favorite . - Uh , may have makings , please ? - Sure , why not ? Thousands are crowding the betting booths . The odds on Avalanche are less than even money but no takers . Golden Fleece is next at 3-to-1 . Shrapnel follows at four and so on down the line . Hold Away at 10-to-1 , Moneymaker at 10-to-1 ... Court Jester at 12 , Honey Girl at 15-to-1 ... and , last but not least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received word that the odds ... - [Groans] - are falling . - Get gun .

When give signal with hat ... laundry boy must become center of attention . Okay , Pop . Be careful . Just a moment . Have most important business with honorable paddock judge . You could n't get in there now if you were first cousin to the favorite . Do not claim relationship with noble animal . Business most urgent . - Now listen , I just told you- - [Fireworks_Exploding] What 's going on here ? - [Guard] I do n't know , sir . - [Man] What 's that idiot doing ? Very sorry .

Avalanche is holding his own with that reserve for which he 's famous . Avalanche is forging ahead . He 's every bit the horse they promised us-a real favorite . Avalanche moves into the lead . Nothing can stop him now . It looks as if he 'll establish a track record for the distance . We could n't believe this horse Avalanche was as good as they promised , but he is . He 's better . Avalanche is now a length in front . He 's got the race in the bag . There 's no doubt about it , ladies and gentlemen . The favorite is still favored . At the three-quarter- Something 's happened ! He 's lost his stride . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one horse after another . He 's almost the real defender again . He 's passed Shrapnel . He 's passing Hold Away . He 's taking the measure of Golden Fleece . He 's still got a chance . You 've never seen a race like this before . This is the wonder horse of the age , the king of the turf . Here he comes . He 's a horse in 10 million . Avalanche is giving everything he 's got . He 's back with the leaders again . Golden Fleece falters . Avalanche is at his quarters . He 's even . They 're fighting it out neck and neck . Here they come- two magnificent animals tearing out their hearts in one last terrific struggle . There 's hardly an inch between them as they shoot down the stretch . This is a finish that 's going down in history . I 've never seen another like it . The final 50 yards .

Warren , did you know that up to 20 minutes before the race ... Avalanche was in your stall disguised as Gallant Lad ? What ? Why , such a thing is impossible . The switch was first made on the boat by Bagley . - Then why are we all herded up here like a lot of criminals ? - Mr . Chan will explain . Have here enlarged picture . Uh , show finish of race .

Dart very evident here ... yet strangely absent one moment later ... when doctor examine Avalanche . All present were first to reach side of noble animal . Someone use cover of excitement to remove dart . - A polite way of telling us we 're going to be searched ? - Have objection ? Not the slightest . You wo n't find it on me , Mr . Chan . Please . Also . This is nonsense . Now wait a minute . Dad , please . We 've nothing to worry about . Here it is . - Dad ! - Someone put that in my pocket . I was n't within six feet of Avalanche . It was you . You were one of the first to reach him , because I remember-Just a minute , Fenton . I see this all very clearly now . You wanted to buy Avalanche all along . When I refused to sell , you stole him and substituted your horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to protect Avalanche . - The whole thing 's ridiculous . The whole thing is obvious . You 're the only one who would have profited by the exchange . With Avalanche running for you as a ringer at 20-to-1 , you 'd have cleaned up a fortune . I guess that settles it , Mr . Fenton . You 're under arrest . - How dare you say that about my father ! - I 'll say more than that . Your father murdered Major Kent who raised Avalanche ... because he would have seen through the switch at once . He had to be gotten out of the way , so you struck him down ... with a winch shoe to make it appear that Avalanche kicked him to death . - That 's a lie ! - Alice ! Pardon , please . How you know winch shoe kill honorable major ? - Why , everyone knew that . - Contradiction , please . Only three beside humble self knew name of death weapon . Honorable chief of police ... most honorable captain of boat ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . It 's all very amusing , but I think it 's carrying a joke a little too far . [Charlie] Cold-blooded murder no joke . You and Major Kent frequently quarreled because of your gambling losses . - Well , what of it ? - Fearing investigation of same ... would reveal self as head of gambling ring ... you kill honorable major on board ship . It is n't true ! My husband often quarreled with Dad , but he could n't have done such a thing . Truth sometimes like stab of cruel knife . You very clever but make mistake . On boat in Honolulu when you receive threatening letter ... have no difficulty reading same without glasses ... because contents familiar . But glasses necessary to read very legible ... time stamp on envelope . Suspected hoax then , so get corroboration later ... when you need glasses to read fake letter ... sent by humble self . Next mistake . When Avalanche received cruel dart ... you make haste to remove same ... fearing evidence point to self . Anticipating search on sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr . Fenton . I think you 'll have a little difficulty in proving that idiotic story . Contradiction , please . Proof already in evidence . Blood of unfortunate Avalanche . Take away , please . So sorry . Mr . Chan , I have a confession to make . Have already arranged for you to make same to honorable stewards of track . - You knew ? - Too bad you did not expose plot ... when you first discover switch of horses . Temptation to cash in most unfortunate . Mr . Lansing , I will remove my stable from the track at once . I think that 's very wise . Wait for me , Dad . I just want to say good-bye to Mr . Chan . I do n't know how to thank you , Mr . Chan . You 've done so much for Dad . Uh , young man win money on race ? Enough to furnish a four-room flat , I guess . Good wife best household furniture .

I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial of the conspirators ... in the assassination of our beloved president ... you have on your souls a grave responsibility . We realize it very deeply , Mr . Secretary . The object of this trial is not to determine the guilt or innocence ... of a handful of rebels ... but to save this country from further bloodshed . The solemn truth , gentlemen , is ... that the federal union is on the verge of hysteria . That is why the trial of these conspirators has been placed in your hands ... rather than in a civil court - - because men of the sword can be hard ... and hardness is all that can save this country from riots , mob rule ... even a resumption of the war itself . - Have you any suggestions , sir ? - Two , to help you to be hard . First , you must not allow your judgment and decision in this case ... to be troubled by any trifling technicalities of the law ... or any pedantic regard ... for the customary rules of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow yourself to be influenced ... by that obnoxious creation of legal nonsense - - reasonable doubt . [Crowd_Shouting] - Is that clear ? - Yes , it 's clear . Briefly ... the voice of this court has got to be the voice of the people . [Angry_Shouting] Before you start , I want you to hear that voice . Listen to it . [Angry_Shouting_Continues] [Chattering] Bring the prisoners . Prisoners to the bar . This court is now in session . - Mr . President . - TheJudge Advocate General . The death ofJohn Wilkes Booth ... who was shot down while resisting arrest in Virginia ... has left us eight members ... of his criminal band . So , in the name of the government of the United States ... the crime of assassination and conspiracy ... to assassinate Abraham Lincoln ... then-president of the United States ... is charged against the following : David E .

I 'm confident , Mr . Erickson ... that after observing the conduct of these trials ... Dr . Mudd 's respect for this court ... is every whit as great as my own . [Man] Frank J . Thomas will take the stand . Tell the court what you know ... of Dr . Mudd 's loyalty to the federal union . Dr . Mudd was a dyed-in-the-wool slaver . Yes , sir ! Slaver ! Dr . Mudd 's name was on the prescription which I filled . Dr . Mudd served in the Confederate Army . Dr . Mudd denied that he 'd ever seen Booth . Dr . Mudd denied everything ... until I showed him Booth 's own boot right in his own home . Dr . Mudd , when I examined him in prison , confessed to me ... that he set Booth 's broken leg and then aided him with directions ... how to reach the Potomac and Virginia . - The case is ended . - No ! No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense you 're gon na hear whether you want it or not . - The prisoner will observe order . - Why ? Why ? What more could you do to me ? What threat have you got left ? You can hang me . You can hang us all - - the innocent as well as the guilty ! Because you - - you nine gallant officers and gentlemen - - have stripped yourselves of your pride and your honor . But I 'll not go without a fight . I 'll not go without trying to blacken your memories with the insane injustice ... you 'll carry on your souls till the day you die . ! And till the day you die , you 'll ask yourselves in your heart three questions : Does an assassin confide his plans to anyone ? Was I , a physician , in the plot ... because it was part ofJohn Wilkes Booth 's plan ... to break his leg and to need me ? Does a man , whose first devotion is no longer to a lost cause or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his child ... risk any act that could only cause misery and heartbreak ... on their innocent lives ? In the sight of the holy God I worship , I 'm innocent . The court will ignore the remarks of the prisoner . Sergeant ! And -- And you still ca n't tell me what they 've decided ? Lady , I must have told you 40 times ... that I do n't know any more than them bulletins . He 's coming now .

Now , before we go any further here ... I want you to listen to me ... because I know exactly what you 're thinking ... every mother 's son of ya . You 're figuring on whether you 're gon na be able to break out of here . Well , we got a little way here of putting thoughts like that ... out of your heads . Follow me . You first , Doctor . Come on . Get up ! Halt ! Now , whenever you slops get to figuring ... on breaking out of here ... I just want you to give a little thought to this moat . It runs all around the island . It 's 7 5 feet wide ... and 35 feet deep . And you know what we keep in it ? We keep pets in it . Nice little pets . We got more pets in that moat than you can count . And sometimes we feed ' em . Not often . Oh , no . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to give ' em a little treat . Now watch close . ## [Whistling] [Buck] ! Move on , white man . - A prisoner , sir . - Just a minute . Now , you know , that 's quite interesting . Those are mosquito larvae . See there . But not very interesting to anyone but a medico , I 'm afraid . Well , I 'm also a physician , sir . No . Now I am pleased . That 's Dr . Mudd . Oh . Well , I - - I thought that -- I thought that , that as another physician , you would understand the circumstances - - the obligation of a doctor to - - to give aid to anyone , whoever he might be . Mr . Mudd ... if you assumed you might find sympathy here , get rid of the idea . The profession you have dishonored is ashamed of you ... ashamed of your membership in it . As a doctor , I may tell you that I despise you even beyond the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... to swear to you on the - - on the honor of the profession we both respect ... that I had nothing whatsoever to do with - - with the death of Mr . Lincoln ? It would be of no use whatever . I 'm sorry , sir . Bugle : Taps [Ends] [Buck] Marse [Sam] . ! Marse [Sam] . - Oh , [Buck] . - Marse [Sam] . I 's sorry , sir ... but I was too scared this afternoon . I could n't say nothin ' to you then . Oh , I knew . I knew that . Tell me , what are you doing down here ? - Oh , I 've been here a month waiting for you , sir . - You have ? Yes . You see , Mrs . Mudd , she told me to get on down this here man 's island . [Chuckling] So here I is - - done gone on down on it . Oh , you - - you 've given me the first hope I 've had since this - - since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But , uh , here 's some soap I brung you . - What ? Oh , yes . I guess I do need it . - Yes , sir . - But it 's for the mosquitoes . - Mosquitoes ? - Yes , sir . You put it on your face and hands . - Oh , I know . I know . Yes , sir , because there 's more mosquitoes on this here man 's island ... than I 've ever seen before . - I know . That 's why -- - Watch it . [Footsteps] My home , sir . Darling , General Ewing . How do you do , General ? This is Judge Maiben of the district superior court . Why , how do you do , Judge ? - How do you do , sir ? - The judge is a Yankee , but he 's honorable . - Thank you , [Colonel] . - He 's gon na get [Sam] out of jail . - But , Colonel-- [Colonel] , please -- - Wo n't you sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me explain , General . At my request and for my own satisfaction ... Judge Maiben 's gone over the whole record of the case word by word . On the evidence produced , no civil court could hold Dr . Mudd for 1 0 minutes . You have some sort of plan , Judge ? The plan is , uh , Mrs . Mudd 's . No judge 'd dare devise anything quite so , uh , extreme . I explained toJudge Maiben what happened ... to the writ of habeas corpus you obtained for [Sam] . The government simply laughed at it . But ... if a writ was served on him in , say , Key West ... a civil municipality , it would be honored , would n't it ? Of course . But Dr . Mudd 's not in Key West . - I know he is n't ... yet . - What did I tell you ? But , great Scott , Mrs . Mudd , you surely would n't dare -- General Ewing , I 'd dare anything for my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It 's exoneration too . He 's innocent , and I want them to say so to the whole world . - But if we wait -- - Wait ? Wait for what ? For the government to kill my husband ? That 's all we 've done is wait and trust and have faith . Oh , I 'm so sick of waiting . I 've found a way to get [Sam] out . Just a moment , Mrs . Mudd . Now , all I have to say is this . If Dr . Mudd should be able to deliver himself to the civil authorities in Key West ... I could have a writ of habeas corpus there to be served on him . Now , under its protection , he could be brought back here . I 'd reopen the case , and I feel sure ... give him a far different trial than the one he had at the court-martial . But as to how Dr . Mudd ... is going to be able to get to Key West ... well , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , and remember ... I wo n't be the only Yankee who 'll be praying with you . - And do n't let anything disturb you . - I won't . - Good day , gentlemen . - Good day . We 'll sell , pawn , mortgage everything . We 'll get enough money . Oh . You understand what this means to me , do n't you ? It 's all that 's left of our lives - - [Sam] 's and [Martha] 's and mine . And it 's only your support - - your support behind us - - that we 're asking . You can leave the escape entirely to me , sir . Within 2 4 hours , I 'll have 5,000 of my old brigade under my command . We 'll seize a war vessel or two and blow the whole dad-blamed prison to ashes ... and deliver [Sam] in Key West with a guard of honor . I 'm sorry , Mrs . Mudd ... but if you 're set on such a foolhardy plan ... I must withdraw from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to be free to be tried . - It 's the only way . Oh , do n't you see ? - I 'm sorry . - The risk is too great . - Igad , sir ! And if you 'll take my advice , you too will abandon this mad scheme . - What do you think ? - [Chuckles] Igad , sugar ... we 'll show these dad-blamed , chickenhearted Yankee lawyers ! [Groans] You leave it to me . I 'm gettin ' tired of this fiddling ' around , messin ' around . Lawyers ! Lawyers are no-good -- Oh . Yeah , lawyers are dad-blamed old women with their habeas corpus and all that . Lookee there . There . You see that ? StonewallJackson gave me that . Pure Toledo . And if I do n't get $1 50 for that ... I 'll have the pleasure of spitting the heart of the swine that dare offer me less . Open the door ! Marse [Sam] ! - Marse [Sam] ! - Yes , [Buck] ? Thanks . Thanks . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed my name up a little bit to make it sound kind of nice . [Buck] , I 'm ready . - But tonight , sir ? - Yes , tonight . But how about the moat and them sharks ? - I 'm gon na have to try the bridge . - But they got a guard on it . - Yeah , I know . - Watch it . - Marse [Sam] . - Yeah . - If I could go with you -- - Yes . I can arrange to be the guard that 's on the bridge . If you could arrange to be the guard on the bridge , we could both go together . - Now , listen . - Yes , sir . There 's gon na be a boat . It 's gon na flash two lights . I 'm gon na have to swim to it . [Guard] Nice view ? [Lock_Unlatching] What 's outside ? Just outside . Do n't start anything you might be sorry for , Doctor .

Do n't worry , if I 'm stuck with a rich girl I 'll grit my teeth and make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make millions yourself . - But , no , I 'm not . - Yes , you are . - No . - Yes . - No , not Mr . Case 's little boy . I 'm a plain man of the people . I began life with these two bare hands . So did the gentleman over the fireplace . Take heart from Grandfather . - Do n't tell me you 're one of those Setons ? - Yes , Johnny . Forgive us , but we are . This is too much . What man has done , man can do , or words to that effect . Now see here , if you think I 'm going to be any young wizard of finance , you 're ... . Cheer up , it 's not at all that serious . If you do n't think breaking the news of this engagement to Father is serious ... . - You said you were going to church ? - I am . That 's why I 'm clever . Because Father 's in church and in church Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? - No . But this is the best way . You know , Father is a wonderful man , but he has to be handled just right . You leave that to me . Your job is to drop me off at church and be back before 1:00 for lunch and do n't be late . His first impression of you is terribly important . What if I crawled in on my hands and knees ? Would he like that ? Now do n't jest , boy . Now , come on , darling . Let 's not let the fun get out of it . - Is it likely to ? - No , but ... . Say it . Well , what 's the idea of spilling it so quickly ? Well , I have to tell Father . He 'd never forgive me . Yeah , but it could be such a swell guilty secret for a while . I ca n't see what particular fun a secret would be . - Ca n't you , dear ? - No . All right . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - You did n't think it 'd be simple , did you ? - I suppose I just did n't think . - You could n't have . Johnny , what 's the matter with you ? I just hate the thought of sitting down with another man and being practical about you . Angel . Look , darling , it 's got to be done though . - I love you , Julia . - I love you , Johnny . - That 's the main thing , is n't it ? - Darling , that 's everything . - Kiss ? - With pleasure . Why , Julia , for shame . Is this the way to spend Sunday morning ? Who 's your partner , anyone I know ? Johnny , my sister , Linda . This is Johnny Case . - How do you do ? - Well , thanks , and you ? - Could n't be better . - Good . - He 's Johnny Case . I 'll marry him . - That makes it all right then . In about one month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here in the light , will you , Case ? - I 've never seen him before . - Neither had I until 10 days ago at Placid . But how did you get together ? Tell me everything . - I was ... . - Well , I ... . Go ahead . I was walking along the road one morning to the rink when whom should I see , but this man coming along carrying his skis . Well , fancy that . A downright romance . Go on , dear . He had a queer look on his face . I can believe that . His eyes must have been burning . No . As a matter of fact , the trouble was with his nose . So I stopped him and said : " Pardon me . I do n't think you realize it , but your nose is frozen . " He said , " Thanks . Can you personally do something about it ? " - Fresh . - I thought so , too . She was fresh to mention it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing when I see it . Just a minute . Does Father know about these goings-on ? I 'm off to church to tell him now . This modern generation . Well , young man , I hope you realize what you 're getting yourself in for . I did n't know I was marrying into a house with an elevator . It is n't only the elevator . The place is haunted . You mean ghosts ? Frightful ghosts all wearing stuffed shirts and mink-lined ties . Any skeletons in the closet ? - Julia has n't told you about Grandfather ? - No . - He stole a railroad from the stockholders . - That 's not true . And of course you 've heard about me . I 'm the black sheep . That 's a goat . - Do n't pay attention to her . - The engagement 's off . I wo n't marry into any family with a black sheep . - I think I like this man . - Hello . You 'll see him at lunch . ' Bye , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , Sis . Placid was lovely , Father . I met a young man up there . He 's coming to lunch today . His name is Case . Johnny Case . - I 'm going to marry him , Father . - What ? Did I understand you to say ... . And who may Johnny Chase be ? - Case , Father , not Chase . - Well , then , Case . Father . Will you please tell me ... . Marry ? Did you actually say that ? Charming service . - A lovely service . - Thank you . - We shall have to talk at once , Julia . - Yes . You have n't as yet told me one intelligent fact about this ... . Johnny ? He 's a man with a definite future . He 's with Sloan and Hobson . - Indeed ? I know Sam Hobson . - You do ? Hello , Julia . Hello , Marjorie . You look well . - A mild , lovely Sunday , Edward . - Quite . - Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . I do n't seem to have been there when it happened . - Good morning . - Good morning . Good morning . Kindly put your hat on , Ned . I believe I see Mr . Hobson now . - Run along home . - Yes , Father . Take your time , Father . The front door this time . Miss Julia has not returned from church yet , sir . I 'll walk around the block . - You 're expected in the playroom , sir . - Playroom ? Miss Linda asked that you be sent up the moment you arrived , sir . Miss Linda . - The playroom is on the fourth floor , sir . - Thanks . - Hey ! - Hey , yourself . I 'm lost . A lot of people have n't been coming up here . Want a bite ? Thanks . The bell captain sent me up . This is quite different . From the rest of the house , I mean . This was Mother 's idea . She thought there should be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here as much as we were before she died . I think it was a kind of escape for her . She was marvellous . That 's quite a doll . - That was Julia's . - Yeah ? She loved it . My , how she loved it . Looks like her . Did she love that , too ? Now do n't you say a word about Leopold . He 's very sensitive . - Yours ? - Looks like me . - Who 's the musician in the family ? - My brother , Ned . I saw him this morning when I arrived . At least I saw somebody with a hangover . That was Ned . He could have been a fine musician . - What do you mean ? - lf Father had n't interfered . - Who performed on the flying trapeze ? - All of us . And a terrible cousin of ours named Seton Cram . He and I used to swing by our knees and spit at each other . - Nice goings-on . - I 'm happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I as kids . She was beautiful even then , was n't she ? Case ? What ? I love my sister Julia more than anything else in the world . I do n't blame you , so do I . She 's so sweet , you do n't know . Yes , I do . She 's beautiful and exciting , too , do n't you think ? Stop it . I 'll start jittering . It 's terribly important that she should marry the right person . - That 's important for everyone . - No . It 's particularly so for Julia . I suppose you realize you 're a rather strange bird in these parts ? How 's that ? You do n't know the men we see as a rule . Where 've you been ? Working hard . - Nights ? - Nights , too . What about these little jaunts to Placid ? Come clean , Case . Want to know something ? That was the first holiday I ever had . - No . - Sure . - Then you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was 10 . - Ten ? - Sure . At what ? Anything I could get . Financial house the last few years . Does she paint ? She never told me . No , you don't . - Why , is n't she any good ? - It is n't hers , it 's mine . There lies Linda the artist . Do n't disturb the ashes . Frankly , I stank . What did you try after you discovered you could n't paint ? - Case , are you drawing me out ? - Sure . Come on . - You really want to know ? - Sure . Well , I tried to go on the stage . Would you care to see me do the sleepwalking scene from Macbeth ? - " Out , damned spot ! " - No , some other time . The teachers at Miss Porter 's School thought it was very promising . - What else ? - There were lots of humorous episodes . I tried to get Father to let me take a nursing course at a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help some strikers over in Jersey . How was I to know that Father was on the board of directors of the company ? You see , Case , the trouble with me is that I never could decide whether I wanted to be Joan of Arc , Florence Nightingale or John L . Lewis . - What 's the matter , you fed up ? - To the neck . Even with this million-dollar museum ? All those marble pillars down there ? Case , compared to the life I lead the last man in a chain gang thoroughly enjoys himself . What you need 's some time off from what you 've been doing day in , day out . You mean from what I 've not been doing days in , please , years out . How does your garden grow , Case ? Is life wonderful where you are ? It can be . - But it has n't been ? - I do n't call what I 've been doing " living . " - What do you recommend for yourself ? - A holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I need . - You mean just to play ? - No , I 've been working since I was 10 . I want to find out why I 'm working . The answer ca n't be just to pay bills or pile up more money . Even if you do , the government takes most of it . - But what is the answer ? - That 's what I intend to find out . The world is changing out there . There 's new exciting ideas running around . Some right , some cock-eyed , but they are affecting our lives . I want to know how I stand , where I fit in , what all this will mean to me . I ca n't find that out sitting behind a desk in an office . I 'm going to get money together , and then knock off . - Quit ? - Quit . I want to save part of my life for myself . There 's a catch to it though , it 's got to be part of the young part . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work when I know what I 'm working for . - Does that make sense to you ? - That makes a lot of sense . - Does Julia know ? - No . I wo n't get her hopes up until I get enough money . She has enough for two right now , or for 10 , for that matter . I do n't want her dough . I 've got to earn it myself . That 's foolish . You 're all right , though . You have n't been bitten or caught by it yet . - By what ? - The reverence for riches . - Look out for that , Johnny . - No , not for me . - Who took the Scotch from my closet ? - What happened in church ? - It was in my riding boots , a full quart . - Neddie , shut up . Did Julia tell Father ? I have n't been up here in years . What did Father say ? We left Father talking about that guy to Mr . Hobson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I 'm the egg . And he 's a good egg , too . Johnny Case , my brother , Ned . How are you ? Congratulations ! This place gives me the creeps . I 've been telling Johnny about some of our childhood dreams . Some dreams . It 's in tune . I thought you 'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing . The Seton Concerto in F Major . Come on , Neddie . Neddie , play it . Play it , Neddie . Johnny and I can bear it . Ca n't we ? You really want to hear it ? Neddie , no . I 've been boasting about you . Hello . What are you all doing up here ? What a morning . - What did Father say ? - He is n't home yet . I want to know the minute Mr . Seton returns . Buzz up here twice , will you ? Thanks . - Was it terrible at church ? - Not so bad , but there 's dirty weather ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't change that tie . - That 's right , I did n't . Well , never mind , Ned can lend you one . I feel like a goat being prepared for the sacrifice . Now , that 's a sheep . What you need is a drink . - We 'd better give him some coaching . - I 'd be grateful . Firstly , Father will want to know how you 're fixed . - Fixed ? - Money . How much ? You would n't expect it of a man in Father 's position , but money is our God here . - Johnny , it is n't true at all . - No ? What is , then ? Well , young man ? Well , sir , at the moment I have in my pocket exactly $34 and a coupon for a Bank Night at a Lake Placid movie . No gilt-edge securities , no rolling woodlands ? I have a few shares of common stock tucked away in a warm -- Common , do n't say the word . I 'm afraid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but probably just another of the vast army of clock-watchers . - How are you socially ? - Nothing much there either . Your mother was n't even a whooziz ? - Nope . - Linda , I do wish you 'd shut up . - Maybe he 's got a judge in the family . - Yes , that might help . Old Judge Case 's boy . White pillars , guitars a-strumming . - ' Evening , Master . - How you all , Miss Linda ? - Know any prominent people ? Drop names . - Just casually , you know . At Mrs . Onderkonk 's cockfight last Tuesday , whom should I see but Mrs . Marble . - I thought we 'd die laughing . - Johnny , this is rot . " Johnny , " she calls me ... . - Linda , will you be quiet ? - I 'm having a swell time . This is terrible . Do you realize that you are trying to marry into one of America 's 60 families ? When I find myself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Then I do the opposite . As long as you do n't do a back flip-flop . - Can you do a back flip-flop ? Really ? - Sure . But , you 'll have to teach me . I can do almost anything else . It 'll be a pity if it does n't come off , it 'll be a real pity . Yes , it 'll be a pity if this does n't come off , too . Okay . Alley . It 's Father . He 's home . Come on , Johnny . - What about the flip thing ? - No . Linda and I will go down and talk to him . You go with Ned . - Why ? - You 're not supposed to have arrived yet . - When do I arrive ? - 1:00 . 1:00 . And please change that tie . Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance . This is getting very complicated , if you ask me . Nobody asked you . Now go on . Do as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't expect simplicity here . Just think of Fifth Avenue frontage . Lend him a tie , Ned . - You do like him , do n't you ? - She asks me if I like him . Dear girl , do you realize that life walked into this house this morning ? Darling , do n't let him get away . It 'll be the same old story , of course . - I 'm being married for my money . - That 's always flattering , is n't it ? What 's the use of all we 've got unless to get us a superior type of man ? Linda , I hate you to talk like that . But , Julia , seriously he 's like spring . He 's like a breath of fresh air . Do you know what he called this place ? A museum . Julia , here 's your chance . That 's just it . I want Father to see that Johnny has the same qualities Grandfather had . You do n't know Johnny . You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Or where he 's going . - I do . I know , I can see it as clear as day . If it does go through all right , when are you going to announce it ? - Right away . Next Saturday . - Darling , let me give a party for it . Now look , Father is to have nothing to do with it . Saturday is New Year 's Eve . Julia , let 's have some fun in this house before you leave it . - lf Father does n't mind . - No ifs at all . And just a few people . Just your friends and Johnny 's and up in the old playroom . Let me plan it . Let me give it . Let me do something for you once . Me , Julia . I 'd love it darling , really I would . No , but you see , this is awfully important to me now . Now no one must touch my party but me , do you hear ? All right , darling . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Linda it 'll be awful to leave you . Julia , I do n't know what I 'll do when you go . I 've got to do something . I 've got to get out , quit , change on it somehow or I 'll go mad . I could curl up and die right now . Why , my foot . I do n't look sick , do I ? You know , this is a museum . Never mind about me . I 'll be all right . Look out for yourself . Do n't let him bully you . - Good morning . - Good morning , Father . - Did you see Mr . Hobson , Father ? - Just for a moment . There 's another thing to be considered . What is the young man 's background ? What did Mr . Hobson say ? But we must n't rush into things , must we ? I want to be married on January 10 . That 's two weeks from this Tuesday . Impossible . - Why ? - Yes , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy has loads of charm , Father . - You know him ? - I 've heard tell of him . Charm . I suppose it 's solid merit you 're after . The rumour is he 's got that , too . A sterling chap on the whole . A catch , in fact . Have you the financial section of the Times , Ned ? No . I try to take Sundays off when I can . Which reminds me , I 'd like you to remain in the office until 6:00 . - 6:00 ? What for ? - As an example to the other men . - But there 's nothing for me to do after 3:00 . - You 'll find something . See here , Father , if you think I 'm going to fake -- Did you understand me , Ned ? Father , what did Mr . Hobson say ? It was n't the time or place to go into the matter with him . I asked him to drop by tonight . Father , but what did he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a blow . - He appears to have some business ability . He has put through a successful reorganization of Seaboard Utilities . - Seaboard ? Poor fellow . - Shrewd fellow , perhaps . Hobson says the signs are not unfavourable for Seaboard . We 'll buy some in the morning , Ned . But we must know more about Mr . Chase 's background . Case , Father . Let it go . Chase has such a sweet banking sound . - Father , he 's from Baltimore . - Fine , old , pre-war stock , I imagine . Was n't there a Judge Case somewhere ? I intend to know more about the young man than his name and his place of birth . It would be advisable that when he arrives he finds me alone in order that I may conduct the inquiry along my own lines . I wo n't allow the subject of an engagement to come up in my first talk with him . Would n't you like me to hide under the sofa and take shorthand notes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the poor guy ought to see one friendly face in the courtroom . Yes , Henry ? - Mr . Case wishes to be announced , sir . - Yes , Henry . You will all excuse yourselves on one pretext or another . Keep a stiff upper lip , Father . No doubt the fellow is an impostor . - Father . - Yes , Julia ? Remember , I know what I want . Come in . I hope I 'm not late . I got caught in traffic . Father , this is Mr . Case . - How do you do ? - How do you do , sir ? My daughter Linda . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? And my son , Edward . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? Ned , if you and your sisters will do the telephoning you spoke about I shall try and entertain Mr . Case . We 'll be back in a few minutes , Johnny . What would we do without the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Linda ? Me , Father ? I ca n't remember a thing . We seem to be enjoying quite an unusual freedom from snow this winter . I like snow . That 's why I went up to Lake Placid . Placid ? Yes , my daughter Julia has just come from there . Yes , I know . - You 're in business in New York , Mr . Case ? - Yes , sir . I 'm with Sloan and Hobson . An excellent firm . - A born New Yorker ? - No , no . I was born in Baltimore . July 6 , 1908 . I 'm 30 . I used to have a lot of good friends in Baltimore . Let me see . The Whites , the Clarence Whites . - Possibly you knew them ? - I do n't believe I ever did . - No ? And there was Archer Fuller 's family . - I 'm afraid not . Let me see , Colonel Evans , old Philip Evans . No . I have n't been there in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . You see , my father had a small grocery store in Baltimore . Yes . He never made a go of it though and when he died he left several debts which Mother worked hard to clear up . I was just a child at the time and I could n't help her very much . Mother died the May before my 16th birthday . How sad . Yes , it was pretty sad . I had n't any connections except for an uncle who 's in the roofing business in Wilmington . He was n't much good , though . He was inclined to get drunk . Still is . We have an uncle like that but he keeps off roofs . Mother had wanted me to go to a big Eastern college so I worked my way through Harvard . In vacations , I worked in a steel mill and in an automobile factory . One summer I drove a garbage truck . Admirable . No , they simply happened to be the only jobs I could get but you can learn a lot in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard . Anything else , sir ? I beg your pardon ? I should think you would . Is there anything else you 'd like to know about me ? Why , that is ... . Well , Mr . Seton , how about it ? - About it ? About what ? - About Julia and me , getting married . Why , this is a complete surprise to me . I hardly know what to say to you . - Well , " yes " would be pleasant . - I 'm sure it would . However , we must go into the matter a little more carefully , I 'm afraid . The only difficulty about that is the time . Julia 's idea is January 10 . Mine , too . We 'll see about that . May I ask how we shall see , sir ? Mr . Case , I do n't know you at all . I 'll give you every opportunity you permit me . - Lunch tomorrow ? - Tomorrow I have -- Tuesday ? Suppose you meet me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , but Friday 's out . I 've got business in Boston that day . Better make it tomorrow . I 'll see whether I can rearrange my engagements . Ned , Julia , nearly time for lunch , is n't it ? In the meantime , I think Mr . Sloan or Mr . Hobson might say a good word for me . I 'm decent and civilized and I love your daughter , which is n't hard . She seems to like me , too , and that 's about all that can be said for me except that we have a grand chance of being happy . - So do I . - Come on , Father , be an angel . The matter is too important to be decided offhand . You 'll be married when I 've come to a decision and on a day which I will name . - Our plan was the 10th . - That is out of the question . - Yes , Henry ? - Luncheon , sir . - Mr . Seton , l -- - Luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Thank you . I have a haberdasher who 's made my ties for a good many years and that particular pattern I seem to recognize . Possibly , sir , because this happens to be your necktie . Ned and I thought it might bring me luck . Father . Come in , Julia . I thought you might like some hot chocolate . Thank you . I just saw Mr . Hobson leave . - Did you and he have a nice talk ? - Yes . Father what have you decided ? Marriage is an extremely important step for a young girl . Mother was younger than I when she married you . In marrying me , your mother and her family took no risk , either financially or , if I may say so , spiritually . - Johnny will do well financially . - No doubt about it . - Hobson tells me he has great possibilities . - I know it . Then it 's all right ? - Do you see that cigar ? - Yes , Father . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your grandfather smoked the same brand . I know the quality of tobacco in it because I own the plantation where it was grown and I know therefore that when I light it , it will burn smoothly and pleasantly . And I know above everything else that it will never explode in my face . And you 're afraid that Johnny might ? There 's a strange new spirit at work in the world today a spirit of revolt . I do n't understand it and I do n't like it . Do n't worry about Johnny . I know him better than you . My dear , I 've never denied you anything that was in my power to give . He 'll burn , Father , calmly , steadily , pleasantly . It 's only of you and your happiness I 'm thinking . Father you can trust me . I 'll take care of myself . Thank you , Father . - Can we announce it New Year 's Eve ? - I shall arrange a party . How wonderful ! Linda had said something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of hers . I think by now you and I know how to take care of those ideas of Linda's . - It was awfully sweet of her . - Linda has many generous impulses . Father ? Come in , Linda . Is it yes ? Father , I knew you 'd do it . - Be careful , you 'll put my cigar out . - What 's a cigar on a night like this ? Darling , I 'm so glad . Have you told Johnny ? - I have n't had time . - Telephone him right away . Well , then let 's ring bells . Let 's send up skyrockets . Let 's turn on all the lights in the house . Father , are n't you proud of yourself ? Gee , this would have made Mother happy . Mother , you 'd love him . Do n't forget I 'm to give the party to announce the engagement . I 've got it all planned . Just a few people , Johnny 's friends and Julia 's and up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no engraved invitations . I like your tie , too . - By the way , where 's Linda ? - She 'll be down soon . I 'm sure she will . - She just hates big parties . - But not this one ? Johnny , look at Father . He 's just seething with excitement . You 've won his heart completely . - He 's been awfully nice to me . - Father 's such a dear . He made all the arrangements for the party himself . Is that the fellow ? He 's rather good-looking at least . - Hello , Uncle Edward . - Good evening . - Seton . - Good evening , Uncle Edward . There 's Laura and Seton Cram . He 's my cousin . Darling , tell me , when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia ? Shortly after midnight as a surprise . Well , Julia seems divinely happy . What does Linda say ? You know , we have n't seen Linda all evening . Linda has been somewhat indisposed . If asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , Linda 's headaches . Now , do n't worry , darling , we understand perfectly . She shall come down before the announcement . Of course . Now do n't worry , darling , you just leave everything to us , will you ? It 's a lovely party . Now what 's the matter with Linda ? Hello , Dorothy , you look lovely . - Dear , where 'd she get that horrible dress ? - Uncle Edward is worried , is n't he ? - Hello , Bunny . - Hello , Seton . I 'd be worried , too , if I had children like Ned and Linda . Now he takes an utter stranger into the family . I do n't approve of it at all . If Linda had done it I could understand , but for Julia to take an unknown climber ... . Mother 's furious about it . He 's obviously after Julia 's money . Hello , Countess . He does n't even belong to the Harvard Club . Julia , darling , you look lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Hello , Seton . - I 'm Cousin Laura and I 'm so happy about it . My dear , he is attractive , is n't he ? This is my husband , Seton Cram . He 's Julia 's cousin . - I married into the family . - Not a bad family to marry into . Congratulations . - Thank you , Mr . Cram . - Do n't " Mister " him . We grew up together . We 've heard such wonderful things about you . - Have you ? From whom ? - Well , from everybody . My dear , it 's such a shame about Linda . She does have such frightful luck with those headaches of hers , does n't she ? Yes . There 's Ned . We 've been looking for him . Come on . We 'll see you later . - Good-bye , Johnny . - See you later , Johnny . Ned , did you speak to Linda ? How do you like Seton and Laura ? It 's a privilege to meet them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheer up , Johnny . If you find Seton and Laura dull , wait until you meet some of the others . The more you find out about us Setons , the more impressive we become . Father wanted a big family , you know . Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him . Linda was a girl , so she promptly had Julia . Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless . The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land . It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish . It must have been a consolation to Father . He must have been very grateful to Mother . Drink to Mother , Johnny . She tried to be a Seton for a while , then gave up and died . You 're talking through your hat , Ned . But , I 'm not . Ned , what did Linda say ? - She 's coming down , is n't she ? - Do n't make me laugh , Sister . - What 's all this about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . It 's nothing . Just one of Linda 's whims . The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party . Between you and Father you 've changed her shindig into a first-class funeral . She should 've realized Father could n't announce my engagement without a fuss . She should have , yes , but unlike me , Linda always hopes . Bottoms up to Linda . Ned , please , you 've been drinking steadily since 8:00 . Yes , funny old Ned . On New Year 's Eve , too . Johnny , try to stop him . I shall drink as much as I like at any party I agree to attend . And as much as I like is as much as I can hold . It 's my protection against your tiresome friends . Linda 's out of luck . She has n't any protection . Robert , another highball , please . Ned , take it easy . Aye , aye , sir . - The name , sir ? - The name is Professor Nicholas Potter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ' cloakroom is the second door to the left , madam . Thank you . - Hello , Mr . Thayer . - Well . - It 's getting near the New Year . - That 's right , sir . - It lacks about an hour , I should say . - An hour and 38 minutes , Edgar . Thank you , sir . - The elevator is to the rear and right . - Would it be too much -- Hello , Mr . Jennings . - Coming close to the New Year now . - One hour and 27 minutes , Edgar . - He 's fast . - Yes , sir . The elevator is to the rear and right . - Thank you , but you have my shoe . - I beg your pardon . It 's quite all right . A very natural mistake , as a matter of fact . Thank you . I 'll do it . Do n't tell anyone , but I 've got a run in my stocking . Good heavens , we 're ruined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - No , sir . The elevator ... . Is to the rear and to the right . I 'm sorry . - Perhaps we 'd better use the elevator . - To the rear and to the right . I think we 'd better go home . Courage , dear , courage . Remember , we promised Johnny that we 'd come . This reminds me a little of the palace of the Emperor Caligula . - You remember Caligula , do n't you ? - Very well , indeed . Whatever became of him ? - To the rear ... . - And to the right . Now where ? Seems to have been some sort of a residence at one time . It 's the Gashouse Gang , darling . The party 's downstairs . Thank you . Sorry to intrude . No . Wait a minute . - You 're Susan Elliott ? - Yes . My married name is Potter . No , but you lectured once at our school . I 'm Linda Seton . - You 're not . - Yes . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister . - You know Johnny ? - For years . I 'm so glad to see you . Come in . - Who 's that ? - That is my husband , Nick Potter . You can come in , too . Close the door . Who lives here ? I live here . I live here , in a manner of speaking . I see . You would n't eat your oatmeal this morning , so they wo n't let you go to the party ? I 'm the mad sister , the family problem . The one they do n't speak about . - Yes , so was I . - You see what happened to her . - What ? - She had to marry me . A professor without a cent of money . So you 'd better be a good little girl and eat your porridge . - Sit down , will you ? - Thank you . - My , it 's good to be home again . - Yes , we 've had quite a long walk . - This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to give a party tonight . I had it all planned . I was going to ... . Well , it was a good idea . It might have been fun . - Your sister , Julia . - Is she anything like you ? Do n't worry , she 's not at all like me . - Have n't you met her yet ? - No . You must . Johnny 'll be glad to see you . - But you must . It 'll spoil Johnny 's party . - Definitely no . Definitely no . My brother , Ned . I thought you might want a little cheering up . Ned , how sweet of you , how really sweet . I 'm a sweet kid . Take this back to the orchestra leader , please . My brother , Ned , Mr . and Mrs . Potter . Friends of Johnny 's . He used to live with us . We 've come to warn his future bride . He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste . Then we 'll drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? No , I 'm wrong . He does n't need it . Johnny 's doing all right . - What 's on your mind , Ned ? - Nothing 's on my mind . What do you mean , " Johnny 's doing all right ? " I mean he 's doing all right . He 's having a whirl . His hair 's slicked down and Father 's seeing that he meets the important people . My word , are there important people downstairs ? Frightfully important . That 's why I wanted to give a party up here . Miss Seton on New Year 's Eve entertained a group of very unimportant people . To our hostess . May I drink , too ? Believe it or not , I 've just been learning how much it costs to keep up a yacht . - What 's the matter ? - Father sent for me . It 's about Linda . Everybody has begun to talk about her not being here . - She 's simply got to come down . - Got to ? Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - I 'll ask her . - Insist on it . I 'll do what a gentleman can do under the circumstances . - That 's good . Was that good ? - No ! Yeah , marvellous . - Unless I 'm getting drunk . - No . It 's the first champagne I 've had since I was 4 . Not really ? - Do you mind if I play with your toys ? - I think you 'd better . - Thank you . - That 's all right . He 's grand . - Has Johnny any other friends like him ? - There are n't many people like Nick . Or like Johnny either , for that matter . - We 've had wonderful times , we three . - You 'll have a lot more fun with Julia . You must let Ned and me be guest members of the Johnny , Julia , Nick and Susan Club . Look what I 've found . Come on , let 's do Romeo and Juliet . " What light through yonder window breaks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . - Did you ? - This is a lovely one . - Do one for us . Go ahead . Come on , Neddie . It 's all complete , including the characters . You remember any of the lines ? Linda . Johnny , come in . - I have a message for you . - And I have a message for you . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested downstairs . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested right here . - There 's a meeting of the club . - Your club . No . Come on , the party needs you . Now 's the time to come to the aid of the party . But your father is really upset . Why , you do n't tell me . What seems to be the matter ? Everybody has begun to notice you 're not there and it 's embarrassing the family . The ... . Johnny -- Linda , be a good sport now . It will make your father awfully happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on my hands and knees ? That 's telling him . Oh , my . - That 's not Johnny . - No ? - Who is it ? - That 's a very important person . Hello , important person . Do n't be fresh . - Treat important persons with respect . - I won't . - Hello , important person . - Yeah ? Take your place . What is this ? It 's the voice of experience . Nick and Susan ! Sir , that lady is my wife . Nick , thank goodness you came . The face is familiar . But ... . Do we know anyone who smells of violet ? - How 's that , you dog . - No . It ca n't be . It 's Johnny Case . You remember him . John Case , the rail-splitter , friend of the people . Yes . - Well , we 're glad to have you back . - Back ? You mean the marble pillars got me . I 'm ready . I 'll go quietly . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got that off my mind . - Never forget it . There 's something I want you to know . - That deal I mentioned ? - The Seaboard thing ? - I think it 'll go through . - You do n't mean it ? There 's a very fair chance that I 'll be able to quit business next Saturday . So that you can go on the holiday ? Sure , Johnny 's Declaration of Independence . It 's all according to what a Boston crowd called Bay State Power does . - Maybe they 've done it already . - They 'll do it ! - Then let 's drink to Bay State Power . - No , let 's drink to Julia . - Have you met her yet ? - No . If she 's anything like her sister ... . No , we 'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay State Power , love and happiness and ... . Here you are . For the love of Pete , it 's The Witch and Dopey . I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? We like it . Linda , are you aware that there 's another party going on in this house ? You mean that low-class dancehall downstairs ? Do n't speak of it . Excuse me , these are my friends . Professor and Mrs . Potter , Mr . and Mrs . Cram . How do you do ? You old fox , you . Fox ? Sam Hobson 's been telling me about your little haul in Seaboard . You might have let us in the family in on it . - There 's still time . - Not the way that stock 's acting . We have an order to buy 60,000 shares for Ross of Bay State Power all the way up to 30 . - Are you sure of that ? - I took the order myself . That cinches it . - Is that it ? - Just about . Good for you . Come on ! Good for you . Have lunch with me at the club on Tuesday . I think I could help you double your yield . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're probably joking , Professor . With the help of the right people in Wall Street you 'll make more within two years . It would n't take that long if we had the right kind of government . - Like which country for example , Mr . Cram ? - Now no political arguments . - Let 's go downstairs and celebrate . - Yes , this is a wonderful party . - I 'm not going downstairs . - Come on , do n't be foolish . - But , Linda , your father said -- - I thought so but I 'm not going downstairs . - Of course if -- - I would n't keep anyone who wants to . If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I 've seen . And has someone asked you ? Come , dear , we can discuss this later . You would n't care to swing on the trapeze and discuss it now , would you , Seton ? We shall see you later , Mrs . Porter . Professor Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrong . In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club . And present you , my dear boy , with this token of their affection and esteem . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Mr . Toastmaster , ladies and gentlemen . My friends . I am not much of a speechmaker , so I hardly know how to thank you . This young lady and myself have been practicing a few feats of acrobatic skill with which we shall be glad to entertain you . Alley . - Ready ? - Ready . Put on the lights . Uno momento . - Alley . - Oop . Linda . The club is adjourned . Julia , I 've got a grand surprise for you . Just a moment . Come down now . It 's nearly 12:00 and we want the entire party together to see the New Year in . The New Year comes into this room , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see the New Year in as I had planned , as I had asked you -- I think if you do n't mind we 'll go down and see what 's happened to the furnace . Julia , this is Nick and Susan . I told you about them . How do you do ? - And Mr . Seton . - Your friends are always welcome here . I 'll see you downstairs . Thank you , but as a matter of fact Susan has an awful run in her stocking . Why do n't you go down to my room ? It 's on the third floor . Fine . Congratulations on your engagement , Miss Seton . You 're not getting very much , but I 'm sure you can improve him . Kindly walk , do not run to the nearest exit . They 're grand people . - They 'll wait , do n't you think ? - I do n't know . I do n't know . There 's no cause for temper , child . Run along and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . Listen to me , Father , tonight means a good deal to me . I do n't know what or how precisely . Something 's trying to take it away and I ca n't let it go . I 'll put in an appearance downstairs . Then I want to bring those people back here . I want to sit and have supper with them . We wo n't disturb anyone . That 's all right with you , is n't it ? Your place is downstairs . Once more , this is important to me . Do n't ask me why . It has something to do with this room when I was a child and good times in it . What special virtue this room has I 'm sure I do n't know . You do n't , do you ? No , you ca n't . I 'll tell you , this room 's my home , it 's the only home I 've got . There 's something here that I understand and that understands me . - Maybe it 's Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . You thought I 'd come around . You always think people will come around . Not me , not tonight . And I sha n't be disturbed either ' cause if there 's one thing you hate , it 's a scene . I can promise you one if you interfere . I can promise you a beauty . Johnny , so there 's good news , is there ? Was Mother a sweet soul , Father ? Linda , if you 're not happy here why do n't you go away ? I 'll be glad if next month you take a maid and a companion and take a trip somewhere . You distress me . You cause nothing but trouble and upsets . That 's just what I 'm going to do . - No maid and no companion . Just me . - As you wish . I 've been dying to get out for years . I 've never known it so well as tonight . I ca n't stand it here any longer . It 's doing terrible things to me . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . This room . I do n't think you 'll be able to stand it long . I 'll come back when you 've left it . I do n't believe I need to worry about the way you 'll take care of Julia , need I ? We 'll try to manage , thanks , sir . Seton has told us of your very successful manipulations of Seaboard . I consider that a very fine piece of work . I congratulate you . Is n't it marvellous ? What a New Year . When you return from your honeymoon if I 'm not much mistaken there 'll be a desk waiting for you at the bank . That 's very kind of you , sir but the success of the Seaboard deal makes possible a certain plan of my own . But , Johnny ... . A plan ? Yes ? I 'm afraid I 'm not quite as anxious as I might be for the things most people work towards . I do n't want too much money . - Too much money ? - Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my idea to make a few thousands early in the game and then quit for as long as it lasts and try to find out who I am and what goes on now , while I 'm young and feel good all the time . I 'm sure Julia understands what I 'm getting at , do n't you , Julia ? I 'm not sure I do , Johnny . You wish to occupy yourself otherwise , is that it ? Please do n't make me feel guilty about it . Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on . Even if I find I 've had enough of it in three months , I want it . If I let this chance go by , there 'll never be another for me so I do n't think anyone will mind if I just have a go at it , will they , Julia ? Will they , dear ? - Father , let Johnny and me talk awhile . - Just a moment . In all my experience -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise you . Case , it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this . A very strange time . - Father . - I see , sir . Then ... . Then perhaps -- Father , please go down . We 'll come in a minute . He did n't get what I was driving at , at all . Why did you do it ? You knew all that talk would antagonize him . - You think talk is all it was ? - I think it was less than that . I 'm furious with you . It was n't just talk , Julia . You do n't realize what Father is offering you . Wait a minute , dear . - We 'd better get clear on this . - I 'm clear on it right now . If you think you can persuade me that a man of your energy and your ability possibly could quit at 30 ... . If you 're tired and want a rest , why , we 'll have it . Have n't you the remotest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . But you have n't any idea yet of how exciting business can be . See it through . You 'll love it . I know you will . There 's no such thrill in the world as making money . Darling , you do n't see what I 'm aiming at either . Try a little blind faith for a while , wo n't you ? - Come along with me ? - But -- No , the whole way , dear . Johnny , wait till next year or two years and we 'll think about it again . You can do that for me , for us , ca n't you ? You think by then I 'd be a good sport and come around , that 's what you think , do n't you ? It lacks six minutes to the New Year if anyone 's interested . Come on , Johnny . Have Nick and Susan gone ? I do n't know . They were n't in my room . - Perhaps they 're downstairs . - Perhaps . Anyone care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is plain stubbornness and you know it . Listen , Julia . No , that gets you nowhere , does it ? Are you coming ? I think I 'll wait a moment with Linda if you do n't mind . But I do mind . Will you come , please ? In a moment , Julia . You 'd better run on down now , do n't you think ? Not right away . I 'm afraid I wo n't know how to entertain you . I 've done all my stuff . I do n't need entertaining . You would n't care to step into a waltz as the old year dies , would you , Mr . Case ? Yes , I would . I 'd love it . There 's a conspiracy against you and me , child . What 's that ? - The vested interests . - I know . They wo n't let you have any fun and they wo n't give me time to think . I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Poor boy . What about your own evening ? Not so hot either . Poor girl . - Of course , they may be right . - Do n't you believe it . I do n't know . They seem so awfully sure . It 's still your ride , is n't it ? You know where you want to go , do n't you ? - I thought I did . - So did I . Pathetic , was n't it , all my fuss and fury over anything as unimportant as this party . Maybe it is important . Well , if it is , I 'm not , and I guess that 's the answer . Linda , you 're so sweet . Thanks , that 's enough . It was grand . Listen . That 's it , all right . Happy New Year , Johnny . Happy New Year , Linda . You can count on sister Linda , Johnny . Run on down now . They 'll be waiting . Linda . What ? They 've ... . - Your father put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Julia ? Of course I do . Well , if ever she needed you , she needs you now . You 're all that 's left . Go on , Johnny . Happy New Year . Same to you . - What 's it like to get drunk , Ned ? - It 's ... . How drunk ? Good and drunk . Grand . How is it ? Well , to begin with it brings you to life . Does it ? And after a while you begin to know all about it . You feel , I do n't know , important . That must be good . It is . And then pretty soon the game starts . What game ? A swell game , a terribly exciting game . You think clear as crystal but every move , every sentence is a problem . That gets pretty interesting . - You get beaten though , do n't you ? - Sure , but that 's good , too . Then you do n't mind anything , not anything at all . Then you sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . As long as you last . Ned , that 's awful . Think so ? Other things are worse . Where do you end up ? Where does everybody end up ? You die . And that 's all right , too . Ned , can you do it on champagne ? Why ? What 's the matter , Linda ? Nothing . - I know . - Yes ? Johnny . Give me some more wine , Ned . - He 's in a spot , is n't he ? - Give me some , Ned . You can tell me about it , dear . I love the boy , Neddie . I thought so . Great , is n't it ? Great . Here 's luck to you . I do n't want any luck . Ladies and gentlemen , my good friends , I have the honour to announce to you the engagement of my daughter Julia to Mr . John Case . An event which doubles the pleasure I take in wishing you and them a most happy and prosperous New Year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Are n't you thrilled ? Is n't it -- - I am . - I 'm sure you 'll be very happy . - You 're thinking of my sister . - What ? - Not I ! My sister . Linda , now you must get married yourself . - Thank you . - I 'm so happy for you . Thank you for coming down . You must go back to bed . The doctor said you should n't excite yourself . What is this ? Where 's the lucky boy ? I have n't seen the lucky boy since the announcement . - Linda , did you know about it ? - Of course I did . - Where is he ? - That 's something I would n't know . I do n't know . He wanted to argue with Father . He did n't make sense . He said things to Father he had no right to say . Then after the announcement to go downstairs and leave us . It 's horrible . Please do n't be so upset . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . Of all times -- - Linda , is n't it too marvellous ? - Too , too marvellous . I 'll ... . - Linda , now you must get married . - I hope I shall . Linda needs to find a husband . - Hello . It is wonderful , is n't it ? - It 's simply lovely . - Hello . How 's Baltimore ? - It 's fine , thank you . - Have you seen Mr . Case anywhere ? - Mr . Case went through here a moment ago . Through there ? - Did Mr . Case come in here ? - Yes , ma'am , right through here , ma'am . " Happy New Year , " he says . Congratulations to Miss Julia , ma'am . Thank you . - Linda . Come in . - Hello , Susan . I 'm sorry to butt in . Well , as I live . Look , it 's the acrobat lady . - Glad to see you . - Glad to see you , too . Run to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to call . - The phone 's been discontinued . We pay our bills . It 's that we 're planning a little trip . - You 're sailing ? - Tonight . Come on in and help us pack . The university gave me leave to work in France . And we 're doing our best ... . You ought to have some tea or something . You look peaked . I 've been hunting for Johnny . I thought he 'd be here . Have you seen him ? Not since that night . - You knew he walked out . - Yes . He came here and we talked until New Year 's noon . Then he left town to think things over . - His letter said he 'd be back today . - Then I can see him ! He 's probably on his way . Has n't your sister heard from him ? If she has , she has n't told me . - You love her a great deal , do n't you ? - Yes . A lot of good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your father does -- Johnny 'll fix that . Johnny 'll fix everything . If I could only make Julia and Father listen to me . I 've got to . Johnny 's so sweet , he 's so attractive . What 's the matter with the girl anyway ? She ought to know by now that men like Johnny do n't grow on every bush . Linda , is n't it just possible that the things we like in Johnny may be the very things she ca n't stand ? The fate that you feel he 'll save her from is the one fate in this whole world she wants ? I do n't believe that . Even so , she loves him and there 's been a break . Would n't you think she 'd be woman enough to hang on ? Yes , if she loves him . Julia has never in her life loved anyone but Johnny . - Perhaps herself . - That 's not true . Even in this , it 's of him she 's thinking , she may be mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a girl in love feels . - We 're sorry , Linda , really . - No , you 're not . You 're ... . What 's the matter with me anyway ? Even if I told you what was the matter with you , you would n't admit it . - I do n't know what you 're talking about . - Pay no attention to her . If you did anything else then you would n't be what you are . Which to my professorial mind is head of the class . - I love you two . - And so do we love you . In our rough , uncouth way , of course . - Johnny is seeing your sister this afternoon . - Yes ? He 's asking her to sail with us and with him tonight . - What do you think she 'll say ? - Yes . What if she does n't ? What happens then ? What 's Johnny to do ? What would you want him to do ? That may be he . Nicholas Porter ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Thanks . Julia will sail , she must , she 's got to . Good-bye . Julia . Hello , dear . You 'll be late for the Todds ' dinner , wo n't you ? You had luncheon with Johnny . He wants you to sail tonight . - You 've seen him ? - The Potters told me . You must sail with him . - The Potters ? Who are the Potters ? - Stop it , Julia . - Stop what ? - Pretending you do n't care . You 're taking my little difficulty more seriously than I am . Do n't let Johnny go off tonight and make a hash of both your lives . You ca n't let him sail alone . He 's no more sailing than you are . Does Father know you are n't going to the Todds ' dinner ? Why do you want to shut me out in the cold like this ? I was n't aware that I was . Wo n't you just talk to me ? Please , Julia . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done it . Me ? Johnny and I have had a difference and you 're siding with him , are n't you ? But he 's right . - He 's right for you as well as for himself . - I think that 's for me to decide . - Not Father ? - Father has nothing to do with it . He happens to agree with me where you do n't . But ... . But we 've always agreed before , always . No . I think quite often I 've given in , in order to avoid scenes and upsets and ... . Is that true , Julia ? You 've always been the stronger character . At least people have always thought so . You 've made the decisions and had the ideas . And you 've been resenting me . I ca n't believe it . It 's nothing to get into a stew about . I did n't say I resented you . You 've been an immense help often . When it comes to determining my future and the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julia ? What do you want , just security ? Sit back smugly in your bank vault among the worthies of the world ? One thing I do n't want is to start this endless discussion all over again . You 've only 20 minutes in which to dress . Linda , did you hear me ? Father , I think you 're both giving Johnny the rottenest kind of a deal . - In what way ? - In every way . - You 're not thinking of what 's best for him . - On the contrary . The young man 's outlook has merely become somewhat confused . - You 'll straighten it out for him . - We shall try . But why has n't he the right to live part of his life as he wants to ? Linda , I should like to understand what he and you are aiming at but I confess , I can not . I consider his whole attitude un-American . - Are you serious ? - Entirely . Then he is and he wo n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life devoted to piling up money is all it 's cracked up to be . Strange , is n't it , when he has us right before his eyes for such a shining example ? I listened most attentively the other day to our young dreamer and I still must confess that the talk of the two of you seems to me of the 17-year-old variety . I 'm glad if it is . We 're grand at 17 . It 's after that , that sickness sets in . Well , I feel very well myself . You both think he 'll come around . Compromise , anyway . You 'll get fooled . He wo n't give way one inch . - Stubborn ? - No , right and knows he 's right . What 's the matter , kid ? I ca n't believe it , Ned . Johnny 's clearing out . He 's sailing tonight and Julia wo n't lift a finger to stop him . I do n't understand her . Most people , including Johnny and yourself , make a big mistake about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At bottom she 's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in . You 've just never hit it off , that 's all . - Ned . - What ? You remember what we talked about on New Year 's Eve ? Sure , I remember . - Tell me something . - Sure . Does it stand out all over me ? Why ? Nick and Susan , this afternoon . I think they got it . Anyone who loves you would , Linda . That 's awful . I 'm so ashamed . I 'm not , though . Why should you be ? Pardon me , Miss Linda . - Yes , Henry . - Mr . Case is downstairs . Have him come up , will you , Henry ? And , Henry , tell Miss Julia . He 'll be up in a minute . Are you sure you want to get over him ? No , I 'm not and that 's what scares me most . I feel alive and I love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it ca n't get anywhere so it 's like living on that stuff . - I 've got to get over it . - Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ? Seems ? What do you mean ? Do n't you know ? Let me tell you something . You 're twice as attractive as Julia ever thought of being . You 've got twice the looks , twice the mind and 10 times the quality . You could charm a bird off a tree if you would and why not ? If you were in her way she 'd ride you down like a rabbit . How could you , Ned , knowing the way she loves him ? - How could you ? - All right , Linda . Tell him hello for me , will you ? - Hello , Linda . - Hello , Johnny . I sent for Julia . I feel as if I 'd been away quite a while . Yeah . - I went to Placid . - I see . It was ... . - It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to take that job at the bank . - I see . Only for a while , only for a couple of years . Just until I can get it through to her that ... . It was what she asked and after all , a couple of years is n't a lifetime . - Is it ? - Of course not . - I think everything will be all right , Johnny . - Sure . I can see the way they feel about it . I could hardly expect them to do a complete , sudden about-face but ... . But , hang it , why ca n't they see what I 'm getting at ? Perhaps eventually they will . That 's what I 'm counting on . Linda you agree there 's only one thing for me to do now , do n't you ? Compromise ? Yes . Yes . You think that 's right , do n't you ? - I do n't think it matters a bit what I think . - It does though , Linda . You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's right . Johnny , when two people love each other as much as you do anything that keeps them apart must be wrong . - Good evening . - Good evening , sir . They tell me you 've been away . Pleasant having you back . It 's pleasant to be back . There 's been a rather noticeable absence of snow these recent weeks . Quite . Father , Johnny came tonight to see Julia . That does n't surprise me a great deal , Daughter , not a great deal . Julia , not you and me . Come on , Dada , let 's go bye-bye . Good evening , Johnny . - Get your coat , darling , we 're going out . - Yes , dear . Father , could you explain to the Todds ? Please , close the door . I wish to speak with you both . You insist on putting me into a position that I do n't in the least relish . Who 's there ? Come in , Ned . - Sorry . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Son . Coming between two young people in love is furthest from my wish or intention . For love , true love , is a very rare and beautiful thing . Where are you going ? Please , sit down . And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love , contrary to the adage , should run smooth . I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation . It is of paramount importance -- - I beg your pardon , sir ? - Yes ? If that position at the bank is still open I 'll be glad to take it . I 'm still not convinced . I still do n't believe in it , but it 's what Julia wishes and ... . And I 'm glad to defer to her wish . - You 're not convinced , you say ? - Would you like me to lie to you , sir ? Father , it 's enough for me . Julia said a year or two . I 'll do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only one reservation . If , at the end of that time , I still think it 's wise for me to quit ... - ... there wo n't be any objections . - I doubt there 'll be reason for any . We shall have to see about that . Well , Father ? - When is it you wish to be married ? - As soon as possible . Now the sun shines once more and we 're all friends again . And now what are your plans for your wedding trip , may I ask ? - We have n't any definite -- - It 's wise to prearrange honeymoons . Now let me suggest a little itinerary . You will land at Plymouth or Southampton and proceed straight to London . I shall cable my sister tomorrow . They will be delighted to have you stay with them . He is one of the most important men in British banking circles . You could scarcely go abroad and not stop with your Aunt Helen , Julia . In addition it will save hotel expenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable the Bovays in Paris . He 's expert adviser to the Minister of Finance . A valuable man for you to know . I had thought of this as a honeymoon more than a business trip , sir . There 's no harm in combining a little business with pleasure . I 've never found there was . They have a lovely place , Johnny , just outside of Paris . Now a week in London , a week in Paris , 10 days in the South of France , ideal . Then you could sail from Genoa and return by southern route . I 'll arrange to have your house ready for you March 1 . Thanks , darling . What house is that , Julia ? Father 's lending us a place on 64th Street . Wait till you see it . This is not to be a gift you know , not yet . After you 've occupied it for some time my hard old heart may soften . Listen to him , his hard old heart . Would you also arrange for the servants ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Would you mind telling me what you mean ? I thought this was a trial for a couple of years . If we begin with possessions and obligations we could never get out from under them . No ! No . You 've been extremely kind and generous , but it 's not for us . - But you ... . You said that -- - I 'm back where I was , Julia . I can see now it 's got to be a clean break , it 's simply got to . We 've got to make our own life , there 's nothing to it if we do n't . There 's no other way to live it . Forget about wedding invitations and all the rest of it . Let 's get married tonight . - I must decide now , must I ? - Please . And if I say no ? I 'm going tonight by myself . Very well then . You can go . I suppose the fact is I love feeling free even better than I love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make a go of it . Thanks for trying anyway . Good-bye to you , Linda . You 've been sweet . Good-bye , Johnny . I hope you find what you 're looking for . I hope you do . Linda . Please , do . Good-bye , Ned . I 'll miss that man . He 's gone . - Yes , and in my opinion -- - Good riddance . - He 's really gone . - Never mind . He loves you , he 'll be back . Be back ? " Be back , " did you say ? What do you think I am ? I hope this experience , hard as it may have been -- Do n't worry about me . I 'm all right . Even a little more than all right , I should say . - What 's with you ? Will you kindly -- - You do n't love him . Answer me . Do you or not ? - What 's that to you ? - You do n't , do you ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . - Suppose I am ? - She asks me , suppose she is ! - Are you ? Say it . - I 'm so relieved I could sing with it . - Is that what you want ? - Yes , thanks . Neddie , Neddie , have I got a job now . Is your passport in order ? Mine is . What do you say ? - Well , when ? - Now . Tonight . - I do n't think I could . - Sure you could . If I can , you can . - Where are you off to ? - Will you come ? - Where are you going ? - On a trip . On a big ride . Do you mind ? Will you come , Ned ? - Listen , Father -- - A trip now is out of the question . - You won't . - Can't . - Caught ? - Maybe . - I 'll be back for you , Ned . - I 'll be here . You 've got no faith in Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you think . What if it should ? There will be another . I 've got faith in Johnny . Whatever he does is all right with me . If he wants to dream for a while , he can and if he wants to come back and sell peanuts , how I 'll believe in those peanuts . Good-bye , Julia . Good-bye , Father . - Good-bye , Neddie . - Good-bye , kid . Good luck . Never you fear , I 'll be back for you , my fine bucko . All right . Linda . Try and stop me , someone . Please someone try and stop me . I shall not permit it . I shall ... . - Permit Linda ? Do n't make me laugh . - She 's going with him , is n't she ? Is n't she ? - Going to get her Johnny . - A fine chance she 's got . Any bets ? Any bets , Julia ? To Linda . And while we 're at it , Grandfather . Dear , what a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please stop it , Nick ? I ca n't stop it , Susan . I 'm miserable . Thinking of him I should say . - Shut up , dearest . - For two cents , I 'd call off the whole thing . - Johnny . - Johnny . My word . - Where 's Julia ? - I left her sitting on her golden throne . - Johnny is taking the big ride by himself . - No . Boy , champagne , any amount of it , but hurry . - Oui , Monsieur Porter . - The name is Potter . Let 's change our name to Porter . Then they 'll call us Potter . What happened ? I 've just wakened out of a nightmare . Everything will be all right . I know it is . Come on , children , come on . Is this where the club meets ? Right here .

It 's my contention that the Hungarian Rhapsody is not their national anthem . - And we were the only two standing . - That 's True . - Well , we should be in time after all . - No , that last report was pretty ghastly - You remember ? - " England on the Brink " . - That 's newspaper sensationalism .

Rudolf , give me a hand . - Have you ever read about love ? - It used to be popular . The carpet is already laid at St George 's , Hanover Square .

You 're welcome to what 's left of the cheese . - It 's not steak but it 's rich in vitamins . - Really ? Thank you . I am Afraid They 're not accustomed to catering for so many . Bandrika is one of Europe 's undiscovered corners . Because there 's nothing worth discovering . You may not know it as well as I do .

I like to watch them from my bedroom when there 's a moon . I 'm so glad there 's a moon tonight . Do you hear that music ? Everyone sings here . The people are just like happy children , - with laughter in lips and music in their hearts . - It 's not reflected in their politics you know ? .

One , two . Please , sir , will you kindly stop ? They 're all complaining in the hotel , you make too much noise . - Too much what ? - Too much noise . You dare to call it a noise . The ancient music with which your peasant ancestors celebrated every wedding for generations . The dance they danced when your father married your mother . If you were born in wedlock , which I doubt . Look at them . - I take it You 're the manager of this ... ? - Sure I am the manager unfortunately I 'm accustomed to squalor . tell me Who 's complained ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English lady underneath that I am putting on record , for the benefit of mankind , one of the lost folk dances of central Europe - and furthermost she does not own this hotel . - Sir , do n't you understand ...

She will say , " YoungMan , It 's my room . I did pay for it . Get out quickly . " - How ' s that ? - Good enough . Then shock him with a little ... pchh !

What exactly do you think you 're doing ? Keep away . Would you hold those for a minute ? Put those back at once . - Which side do you like to sleep ? - Do you want me to throw you out ? In that case , I 'll sleep in the middle . Smart of you to bribe the manager . Eye for an eye and a tooth for a toothbrush . I Suppose you realise , You 're behaving like a complete cad . You 're perfectly at liberty to sleep in the corridor , if you want to . - Hello ? - Oh , I should n't , if I were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I say everyone , I mean everyone . I have a powerful voice . - Come out of there at once . - Not until you bribe the manager - to restore me to my attic . - Come out of the bathroom ! Hello . Boris ? Look , I was thinking , I might change my mind about that room upstairs if ... Oh , by the way , you might have my things taken upstairs , would you ? You 're the most contemptible person I 've ever met in all my life Confidentially , I think you 're a bit of a stinker , too . If we get to Basle on time , we 'll see the last day of the match . Hope the weather 's like this in Manchester . Perfect wicket for our fellas . - Is n't it some where here ? - If You Do n't Hurry , Margaret , or we sha n't get a compartment to ourselves . Does it matter ? There 's still time to change your mind Iris . Why not Send Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , it 's too late . This time next week , I shall be a sunburnt offering on an altar in Hanover Square . I sha n't mind , really . Oh , good morning . I ca n't find my bag . It 's a brown holdall , have you seen ...

Oh , she dropped her glasses . - You dropped your glasses . - Thank you . - Oh ! - Oh dear , oh dear , oh , dear . - Oh , my dear . - Darling , are you hurt ? I do n't know . What was it ? nevermind about that.This cockeyed station has brained my friend ! Yes Indeed - What are you going to do about it ? He says , He ca n't hold the train . - Hurry up , it 's going .

Anyways As for you meeting someone you know , what about me ? Robert thinks I 'm cruising with Mother . you must be feeling little shaky , I always think it 's best to sit in the middle of the coach . Preferably facing the engine . - A pot of tea for two , please . - Very good . Oh , and just a minute . Will you please tell them to make it from this ? I do n't drink any other . And make absolutely sure that the water is really boiling . You understand ? It 's a fad of mine . My father and mother , who , I 'm thankful to say , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

May be you do nt understand , I mean the lady who looked after me when I was knocked out . Ah , perhaps it make-a you forget , eh ? I may be very dense , but if this is some part of a joke , I 'm afraid I do n't see the point . - Oh , Steward , you served me tea just now - Yes , madam . - Have you seen the lady I was with ? english lady ? - But madam was alone . - Pardon , he make mistake . - Well ofcourse , He must remember the little English lady . - She ordered the tea and paid for it . - It is you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - but She gave you a special packet of tea . you can't forgot me that - The tea was ours madam , but I receive no packet . - But you did.I know what happened . - Pardon , madam , the bill . - Er , tea for one . - But that 's not right . Perhaps madam would examine the bills ? No , the whole thing 's too absurd . Please , have you seen a lady pass through ... ? Oh . Well , if it is n't old stinker If I thought you 'd be on this train , I 'd have stayed another week in the hotel . - Er , lady , no , why ? - Does n't matter . You probably would n't recognise one anyway . Hello ? Feeling queer ? It 's that pipe of yours . Why do n't you throw your old socks away ? Thanks for the help . - Oh Come on , sit down , Take it easy what 's the trouble ? - You must know Something fell on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . - Bad luck . Can I help ? - Only by going away . Noo NO No . My father always taught me , never desert a lady in trouble . He even went as far as marrying mother . - Did you see a lady last night in hotel in tweeds ? - I saw one lady , hardly in tweeds . - She was in my compartment.i couldn't find her - She must be still on the train.We have n't stopped yet - Of course.Still on the train I know that . - All right . Nobody said she isn't . - That 's just what they are saying . - Who ? The people in the compartment and the stewards . - All of them ? - All of them . - You said you got a knock on the head ? - What do you mean ? - Never mind . Do you talk the lingo ? - No . They probably thought you wanted money . Let 's knock the idea out of their stupid heads . Unfortunate remark , I beg your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark man .

And the lady in the corner is the Baroness Attorna . Yes . I met her husband.He presented crisis at the folk dance festival . Minister of Propaganda . I am Dr Egon Hartz of Prague . You may have heard of me . - The brain specialist ? - The same . You flew to England and operated on a cabinet minister . - Yes . - Did you find anything ? - A slight cerebral contusion . - that's Better than nothing . I am picking up a similar case at the next station.so much more complicated I shall operate at the hospital tonight . A cranial fracture with compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beam . - I suppose You have n't seen my friend ? - Unfortunately No . I 'll just take a word with the baroness . - Scusi , avete visto la signora ? - No . Non I'ha vista . - What do they say ? - They say that they 've never seen her . - But that was n't true , she was sitting where you are . - Can you describe her ? But that 's difficult you see , She was sort of middle age . - What was she wearing ? - Tweeds . Oatmeal , flecks of brown , a three-quarter coat with patch pockets , a scarf , felt hat , brown shoes , a tussore shirt and a small , blue handkerchief in her breast pocket . - I ca n't remember any more . - You were n't paying attention ! - You both went along to tea ? - Yes . - Surely you met somebody ? - I suppose we did , but ... Wait .. let me think . There was an Englishman who passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig him out . - I come with you .

Alrite , Now we are getting some , If we can find someone who saw her , we 'll search the place . - Can I be of assistance ? - That 's the gentlemen Do you remember seeing this lady pass here with a little English woman ? I 'm , er , I 'm afraid not . But you must have . She almost fell into your compartment . It 's very important . Everybody 's saying she was n't on the train but I know she is . I 'm going to find her , even if I have to stop the train to do it . Caldicott , this is Charters , can I come in ? That girl we saw at the hotel is kicking up a devil of a fuss . - Says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . - She threatens to stop the train . - Oh , Lord . If we miss our connection , we wo n't make Manchester in time . - This is serious . - Let 's hide in here . Sorry , I have n't the faintest recollection . You must be making a mistake . Well , He obviously does n't remember . Let 's go and look for the other fellow . Who were you talking to , outside ? Oh , nobody . Just , er , some people in the corridor , arguing . - There he is . That 's the man . - Oh , I wonder if I could bother you ? - I wonder if you can help ? - How ? I was having tea with an English lady . You saw her ? did n't you - I do n't know , I was talking to my friend . - Indubitably . Yes , You were sitting in the next table She turned and borrowed the sugar . - You must remember . - I recall passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discussing cricket . I do n't see how a thing like cricket can make you forget . If that 's your attitude , obviously there 's nothing more to say . Come , Caldicott . Thing like cricket ! We should have said we were looking for a lost cricket ball . - yes , but he spoke to her , There must be some explanation . - There is . Please forgive me , iam quite possibly be wrong , but I have known cases where a sudden shock or blow - has induced a most vivid impression . - I understand . - You do n't believe me . - It 's not a question of belief . Even a concussion may have curious effects upon an imaginative person . Yes , But I can remember every little detail . Her name , Miss Froy , everything . So interesting . you know If one had time , one could trace the cause of the hallucination . - Hallucination ? - oh ! Precisely . There is no Miss Froy , there was n't Miss Froy merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night at the hotel . - You thought you did . - But what about the name ? - Some past association , an advertisement or a character in a novel , subconsciously remembered . There is no reason to be frightened , if you are quiet and relax . Thank you very much . If you will excuse me , this is where my patient comes aboard . Excuse me . Most interesting . - Stopping . - This is the first stop , is n't it ? - Mm-hm . - oh then Miss Froy must still be on the train . you Look out of this window and see if she gets off this side . I 'll take the other . Most interesting . - What was she dressed in , Scotch tweeds ? - Oatmeal tweeds . I knew it had something to do with porridge . How long does it take to get a divorce ? - Eric ? - I-I beg your pardon . I was n't listening . - I said how long does it take to get a divorce ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could take our honeymoon next spring . - I mean , the official one . - The difficulties are considerable . but , one thing The courts are very crowded just now . Although we barristers ought not to complain about that . With conditions as they are now , my chances of becoming a judge are rosy . That is , if nothing untoward occurs . Such as you being mixed up in a divorce case . - Yes In that first careless rapture , you said did n't care what happened . The law , like Caesar 's wife , must be above suspicion . Even when the law spends six weeks with Caesar 's wife ? - Look here Now I know why you 've been running around like a scared rabbit . - Why you lied a few minutes ago . - I lied ? Yes , to those people in the corridor . I heard every word you said . merely , I did n't wish to be mixed up in any inquiry . Inquiry ! Just because a little woman ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman had disappeared and I 'd admitted having seen her , we might become vital witnesses . My name might appear in the papers , coupled with yours . A scandal like that might lead anywhere . - Anywhere . - Yes . I suppose it might . - Nobody ? - Nobody . All that came out my side was two bits of orange peel and a paper bag . I know there 's a Miss Froy . She 's real as you are That 's what you saying , I believe it but does nt appear nobody else has seen her . I saw her , I think . You did ? - A little woman in tweeds wearing 3 quarter clothes - With a scarf ? - that's rite - I saw her with you when you passed the compartment - I knew I was right . - But Your husband said he had n't seen her . - He did n't notice but as soon as he mentioned it I remembered at once You win . This calls for action . Would you make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Pardon , my patient has just arrived.most fascinating complication We 've some news . This lady actually saw Miss Froy . - So We shall have the train searched . - You like to think a fresh theory . doctor ? It is n't not Necessary , My theory was perfectly good one . The facts were misleading . - I hope you find your friend . Excuse me . - I 'll be in here if you want me Right you are . Come along . Eric . I was only going to mention that i told that girl that I 'd seen her friend . - Have you taken leave of your senses ? - On the contrary . I 've come to them . - What do you mean ? - If there 's scandal , there 'd be a divorce . You could n't let me down.could you You will have to do the decent thing , - as reluctantly as only you know how . - You forget one important thing , Margaret . Your husband would divorce you but whatever happens my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to search the train . Ah , signorina ... Your friend , she come back . - Come back ? - S ? , s ? . - But what happened ? - You go see . She tell you . Scusi . Thanks . All right , relax , the crisis is over . come on , Let 's join the lady . - Here we are . - Miss Froy . - That is n't Miss Froy . - Is n't it ? - No . - It 's silly to say but are you Miss Froy ? No . I am Madam Kummer . She helped you into the carriage , then went to see some friends . As you spoke of the English lady , she did n't connect her with Madam Kummer . But she was n't the lady i saw . It was Miss Froy . - Oatmeal tweeds , blouse ... - yes I know , everything 's the same - but it is n't her . beg your pardon - When did you meet Miss Froy ? - Last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume like this ? - Yes , I think so . - Then I must apologise . You did meet her . - Then ... - But not on this train . In your subconscious , you substituted Miss Froy for Madam Kummer . but I did n't . I could n't have actually I talked to her here . An English lady saw her . If this lady would n't mind ... Bon , apr ? s vous , madame . What a gift for languages the fellow 's got . Would you tell us , is this the woman you saw ? It is n't a bit like her , is it ? - Yes , she 's the woman . - It is n't , I tell you . Are you sure ? - Perfectly . - She is n't , she is n't . Come on , then . I 'm so sorry to have troubled you . Well ? Are n't you going to say anything ? - You might at least gloat , if nothing else . - You only did it to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in her face . They 're all lying , but why ? Why do n't you sit down ? take it easy Do you think I substituted Miss Froy 's face for Madam Kummer 's ? - I think a change 'd be an improvement . - Miss Froy was on this train and nothing will convince me otherwise . Must you follow me round like a pet dog ? Let 's say a watchdog , I 've got all the better instincts . Goodbye . The doctor was right , I never saw Miss Froy on the train . I 'm glad you 're gon na take it like that . Forget all about it . Make your mind a complete blank . Watch me , you ca n't go wrong . - What about something to eat ? - Anything . - that's rite come along Would you like a little air ? - Thanks . - Can you eat anything ? - I could try . - that's the spirit You 'll feel a different girl tomorrow . - I hope so . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your what ? I 'm being married on Thursday . - Quite sure you 're not imagining that ? - Positive . Oh , I was afraid so . Ah , food . - I could n't face it . - Mind if I talk with my mouth full ? - If you must . - Care to hear about my early life ? - I do n't think so . - Well then , I 'll begin with my father . you know It 's remarkable how many great men began with their father . Drink ? - A cup of tea , please . My father was a very colourful character and he was strongly addicted to ... You 'll never guess ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . - No ! Double scotch . - A million Mexicans drink it . - Maybe but Father did n't . Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it . - A packet of what ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . We agreed you 'd make your mind a complete blank . - But it 's so real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did we not ? We did . Sorry . Go on telling me about your father . My father was a very remarkable man . - Did he play the clarionet ? - He did . He never put it down unless it was absolutely necessary . I could n't help inheriting his love of music . - Why not ? - It was all he left me . You know , you 're remarkably attractive . Has anyone ever told you ? We were discussing you . - Yes , of course . Do you like me ? - Not much . After I 'd paid my father 's debts , I started to travel , until they tried to cash the cheques . I 'm writing a book now . Would you like to buy a copy ? I 'd love to . When will it be out ? About four years . - That 's a very long time . - It 's a very long book . Do you know why you fascinate me ? I 'll tell you . You have got two qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all and you 're always seeing things . - What 's the matter ? - Look . - It 's gone ! - What 's gone ? Miss Froy 's name on the window . you saw it You must have seen it ! She is on the train Now , steady , steady . We 've got to find her . Something 's happening to her . Stop the train . Listen everybodyThere 's a woman on this train - Miss Froy . They 're hiding her somewhere . I appeal to you to stop the train . Please help me . Make them stop the train . Why do n't you do something before it 's too late ? - Please . - You think I 'm crazy but I 'm not . For heaven 's sake Stop this train ! Leave me alone . - Leave me alone ! Huh ! Ten minutes late thanks to that fool of a girl . She gets up to any more tricks , we 'll be too late for the match . - I suppose you could n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't vanish and so forth . - She has . - What ? Vanished . - Who ? - The old dame . - Yes . - Well . - Well , how could she ? - What ? - Vanish . - I do n't know . That explains my point . People do n't disappear into thin air . - It 's done in India . - What ? - The rope trick . - Oh , that . It never comes out in a photograph . Look , in half an hour we 'll stop at Morshkan , just before the border . I will leave there with my patient for the National Hospital . If you come with me , you can stay overnight in a private ward . - You need rest . - Sorry , nothing doing . Is n't there anything we can do ? Yes . Find Miss Froy . I tell you , if she does not rest , I will not answer for her . You persuade her , she likes you . I 'm as popular as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , she may swallow it . Cosmopolitan trains . People of all nations . I 've just seen at least a million Mexicans in the corridor . I thought I 'd look in to tell you to think over what Dr Hartz said . If you fell like changing your mind , I 'll be hanging around . - What 's all the mystery ? - Miss Froy is on this train . I 've just seen that packet of tea in the rubbish . - She may be dead now . - Dead or ... For sheer variety , give me an English summer ... We 'll search the train . There 's something definitely queer here . Looks like a supply service for trunk murderers . Look at that ! - All right , Miss Froy , it 's only us . - Hurry up . Perhaps it 's Miss Froy bewitched ! I refuse to be discouraged . Faint heart never found old lady . - Do you know anything about her ? - No . Only that she was a governess going back home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might be something down here . - What on earth ... ? - Our Italian friend . I 've got it ! Wait a minute . There you are , the Great Doppo . - His visiting card , look . - What 's it say ? Magician , illusionist , mind-reader see his fascinating act , the vanishing ... lady . - The vanishing lady ? - Perhaps that 's the explanation . - What ? - He 's practising on Miss Froy . - Perhaps it 's a publicity stunt . - No . What about the Baroness and Madame Kummer ? - What 's your theory ? - I do n't know . My theory ? I 'll tell you . Oh , dear ! I ca n't get ... - Where are you ? - In here . With a smell of camphor ball . - I ca n't see you . - I 'm about somewhere . - Here I am . Where are you ? - I do n't know . This is what comes of not saying abracadabra . - Ooh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , out of it . - Not much . - Come and sit down . - What is that ? In magic circles , we call it the disappearing cabinet . - You get inside and you vanish . - So I noticed . You were about to tell me of your theory . Oh , my theory . Well ... my theory , my dear Watson , is that we are in very deep waters indeed . - Ahem . - Oh ! Thank you very much . Let us marshal our facts over a pipe full of shag . A little old lady disappears , everyone who saw her insists she was never there , right ? - Right . - We know that she was , therefore they did see her and so are lying . - Why ? - I do n't know . I 'm only Watson . Do n't bury yourself in the part . They dare n't face an enquiry as Miss Froy 's still on this train . - I told you that hours ago . - Yes , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Ooh , thank you . only onething we got to do we must search the train in disguise . - As what ? Well , er ... - English gentleman . - They 'd see through you . Perhaps you 're right . Aha ! Will Hay . Now , boys , boys , which of you has stolen Miss Froy ? Own up ! - Give those glasses to me . - Why ? - They 're Miss Froy's . - Are you sure ? Yes . Where did you find them ? - Down here . The glass is broken . - Probably in the struggle . Do you realise that this is our first piece of tangible proof ? That 's the lot . Will you please give me those spectacles ? They belong to me . Please . - Are you sure ? - Datemi questi occhiali ! Naughty , naughty . That 's a large nose for a small pair of spectacles . That 's the game , is it ? We 'll see about that . They 're Froy 's glasses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that too . Do n't stand there hopping about , kick him , see if he 's got a false bottom . Hang on , I 'll get him up . Ow ! That does n't help . Quick , pull his ears back . Give them a twist . Now I 've got him . He 's got a knife . Get hold of it before he cuts a slice off me . I ca n't reach it . Aah ! Well done , that 's it . That 's it . We know how that thing works , come out of there . Is he out ? We 've got to hide him somewhere . - What 's in here ? - Hurry up , quick , before he comes to . It 's empty . We can lock it . Come on . - Oh , no , you don't . - What 's the matter ? Garlic . I 'll be all right in a minute . - Here , let 's tie him up . - Oh , yes . So we definitely know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here had something to do with it . That ought to keep him quiet till we find her . Hard work but worth it . Let 's have the evidence . - Evidence ? - The glasses . - You 've got them . - No , I have n't got them . - Oh ! - He 's got them . He is n't there ! Snookered ! It 's a false bottom . - The twister ! He 's a contortionist . - He 's gone . To find the others . We ca n't fight the whole train , we need allies . - But who can we trust ? - That 's the snag . There 's that Dr Hartz person . Yes , you 're right . Let 's show him the symptoms . Oh , wait a minute . This is the one . He 's not there . Listen ... I 've just had a particularly idiotic idea . - I can believe that . - Supposing that patient is Miss Froy . It did n't come on the train till after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , let 's find the doctor . - No , wait a minute . - What is it ? Notice anything wrong about that nun ? - No . I do n't think she 's a nun , they do n't wear high heels . Yes , you 're right . Did you see Madame Kummer get on the train ? - No . - Well ... supposing they decoyed Miss Froy into the luggage van and hid her , the first stop , a patient comes aboard , all wrapped up , the patient is Madame Kummer , she becomes Miss Froy , Miss Froy becomes that . But why go to all this trouble to kidnap a harmless governess ? Maybe it is n't a governess at all . Perhaps it 's some political thing . Let 's investigate . Parlez vous fran ? ais ? Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? You 'll just have to cope with English . Can we look at your patient ? Thank you . Keep an eye on the nun . What are you doing here ? Why are you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no business to be here . leave her view Dr Hartz , we want you to Undo bandages and to look at your patient 's face . Are you out of your senses ? There is no face there . Nothing but lumps of raw flesh . that is the case He has lost so much blood only a transfusion can save him . - Do You want me to murder my patient ? - You 're sure this is your patient ? - We believe it 's Miss Froy . - Miss Froy ! You ca n't be serious ? Whatever put such ideas into your head ? - I understand she 's deaf and dumb . - But she may lip-read . It 's possible . In that case , perhaps you 'll join me in the dining car . I 'll be with you in a moment , I want to be sure my patient has n't been disturbed . How do I know how they cottoned on ? Somebody must have tipped ' em off . You never said the old girl was English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments I shall order three drinks in the dining car . Mine will be chartreuse . One of the stewards is working for us , now , listen.carefully There 's that girl again . Seems to have recovered . Lucky it blew over . Now , tell me what this is all about . Have you ever seen your patient ? No . I just had a message to operate at Morshkan . - How do you know it 's not Miss Froy ? - We believe it 's a substitution . - You really think ... that someone else - tararar umm ... Oh , I want a green chartreuse . - Wo n't you join me ? - Thanks . A large brandy . - And you ? - I do n't want anything . - Come on . - No , really . It 'll pick you up . All right , just a small one . Two brandies and a chartreuse . Do you know anything about the nun who 's looking after your patient ? Nun ! , No , only that she 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's peculiar that she 's wearing high-heeled shoes . Oh , is she ? That is rather curious , is n't it ? It 's a conspiracy . All these people on the train say they have n't seen Miss Froy but they have .. , we know that , because just now in the luggage van .. She 's off again . Hope she does n't create another scene . Put the lid on our getting back in time . ... and then this fella Doppo came and grabbed the glasses . Yeah , we had a bit of a fight . - Oh , a fight ? - We knocked him out . Oh ! - He 's made a speedy recovery . - Yes . All that 's just bluff . - Here . - Grazie . How could he be involved in a conspiracy ? Look at the poor fellow , he 's just a harmless traveller . - He 's also a music-hall artist on tour . - Well ? The baroness 's husband is Minister of Propaganda , he can cancel his tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewards do n't behave , they have a cosy brick wall to run up against . B-But tell me about the English travellers , they denied seeing her . Just British diplomacy , never climb a fence if you can sit on it . I ca n't understand why anyone would want to dispose of the old lady . That 's what stumps us but she was on this train and now she 's ... gone . Well ... if you 're right then the whole train is against us . What are we going to do ? In view of what you just told me , I-I shall risk examining the patient . - Come on ... - One moment . We must n't act suspicious , behave as is if nothing had happened . A drink , that 'll steady your nerve . To our health . And may our enemies , if they exist , be unconscious of our purpose . Let 's go , we must hurry now . Come on , drink up . Wait in here . Go on . - Anything wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels . However , it makes no difference . We shall reach Morshkan in three minutes . Quite an eventful journey . Well ? Yes , the patient is Miss Froy . She will be taken off the train at Morshkan . She will be removed to the hospital and operated on . Unfortunately , the operation will not be successful . Oh , I should perhaps have explained . The operation will be performed ... by me . You see , I am in this conspiracy , as you term it . You are a very alert young couple but it 's quite useless to think of a way out of your dilemma . The drinks you had just now . I regret to say contained a quantity of hydrocin . FYI , It is a little-known drug which has the effect , in a small quantity , of paralysing the brain and rendering the victim unconscious for considerable period . In a slightly larger quantity , of course , it induces madness . However , you have my word the dose was a normal one . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say how sorry I am having to take such a ... How shall I say ? Melodramatic course . But your persistent meddling made it necessary . - Are you all right ? You fainted . - Did I ? Listen ! There is a woman next door is going to be murdered and we 've got to go before this stuff takes effect . I read that if you keep going , you can stay awake . Right . Let 's get going . It 's locked . We ca n't go that way , we 'll be spotted . - You ca n't do that ! - Do n't worry , it 's only next door . You stand on your head , touch ur toes , anything , only , whatever you do , do n't fall asleep . Go on , you need n't be afraid , it is Miss Froy . You have n't been drugged . He told me to put something in your drink but I did n't . Who the devil are you ? He said you are deaf dumb Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've got to hurry . Hartz will be back in a min , what will happen then ? If we can hold him off till get past Morshkan , the frontier 's a few miles beyond the station . Come on , there 's still time . - 500 solamente ? Dopo tutto quello che ho fatto ? Cosa poi di questo orecchio mozzicato da quella ragazza ? That 's Morshkan . Have you finished ? Come on , Miss Froy . Cut it out , you 're not drugged . I 'll explain later . Abracadabra . Miss Froy ! Oh , I ca n't believe it ! - Thank you , my dear . Thank you . - Careful . - Ready ? - Yes . Are you all right miss Froy ? Yes . thankyou It 's like rush hour on the underground . Careful , it 's slowing down . Drat . I 'm sorry you 've had such an uncomfortable journey , Miss Froy . Get back on the train . I hope nothing goes wrong . Are n't we stopping rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be off soon . In a few minutes we 'll be over the border . No , I 've been well-paid but this was murder and she was an English woman . - You are Bandrikan ? - My husband was . I 'm English . You were going to butcher her in cold blood Your little diversion made it necessary not only to remove the lady but two others as well . You ca n't do that . Also , it would be unwise of us to permit the existence of anyone who can not be trusted . - You would n't dare . I know too much . - Precisely . I think we 're over the border now . - You can come out , Miss Froy . - Oh , bless me . What an unpleasant journey . Never mind . You shall have a corner seat for the rest of the way . There you are.Now it 's over , I think you should tell us what it 's all about . - What was that scream ? - It was only the train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbled . We 're on a branch line . Oh , dear , dear . Who are you and why do they want you ? I have n't the faintest idea . I 'm a governess . I can only think that They 've made a terrible mistake . Why are you holding out on us ? Tell us the truth . You might at least trust us . I really do n't kn ... I ... - I wonder if there 's anyone on the train . - There 's only the dining car in front . What time is it ? Teatime . Well , all the English will be there . Come on , we 'd better stick together . There 's the old girl turned up . Told you it was a lot of fuss about nothing . Bolt must have jammed . I 've got something to say . will you all please listen ? An attempt was made to abduct this lady by force and I believe the people who did it will try again . - What 's he drivelling about ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to branch line . - What are you talking about ? - We 're telling you the truth ! I 'm not interested . You 've annoyed us enough already on ridiculous stuff You 've got the wrong end of the stick . - Things like that just do n't happen . - We 're not in England now . - I do n't see what difference that makes . - We 're stopping . See those cars ? They 're here to take Miss Froy away . Nonsense . Look , there go a couple of people . The car 's come to pick them up . - In that case Then why the trouble of uncoupling the train and diverting it ? - Uncoupling ? - There 's no train after the sleeping car . - Our bags are in first class . Not any longer . Like to come and look ? If this is a practical joke , I do nt think it 's not very funny . Good Lord ! Get some brandy . You do n't suppose there 's something in his story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , people do n't tie up nuns . Thank you . Someone 's coming . They ca n't harm us , we 're British subjects . I have come to offer the most sincere apologies . An extremely serious incident has occurred - an attempt was made to interfere with passengers on this train . - The authorities were notified so if you 'll accompany me to Morshkan , I will inform the British Embassy . The cars are at your disposal . We 're grateful . Lucky some of you fellows understand English . - Well , I was at Oxford . - So was I . What year ? This woman 's trying to say something . I do n't understand the language . would you ? That 's fixed him . - What the blazes did you do that for ? - I was at Cambridge . - You heard what he said ? I heard what she said - It 's a trick to get us off the train . I do n't believe it . The man 's explanation was quite satisfactory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going outside . It 's up to us to apologise . Wh ... Do ... - You were right . Do you mind ? - Certainly . Look as if they mean business . - Quite so , we can't do anything it 'd mean an international situation . - It 's happened . - They 're coming . - Do n't let them in ! They 'll murder us . They can't let us go now I order you to surrender at once . Nothing doing . Come any nearer , I 'll fire . I 've warned you . Better take cover , it 'll start soon . Nasty jam this . Do n't like the look of it . - Got plenty of ammunition ? - A whole pouch . - Duck down . - I 'm not fighting . It 's madness . It 'll be safer to protest down here . They 're trying to work around other side You 're behaving like fools . What chance have we got ? You heard what the mother superior said - we surrender and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Give it to me . Give it to me ! - No . - What 's going on ? - He 's got a gun and he wo n't use it . - What 's the idea ? - told this I wo n't be a party to this . - I do n't believe in fighting . - Pacifist , eh ? Wo n't work . Hand it over . I 'm not afraid to use it . I 'm probably more used to it . I once won a box of cigars . He 's talking rot , he 's a damn good shot . You know , I 'm half-inclined to believe ... that there 's some rational explanation to all this . Rotten ! Only knocked his hat off . Would you mind if I talked to you for a minute ? - What , now ? - Yes , forgive me but it 's very important . - Hang on to this , will you ? - All right . I think it 's safer along here . You come , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting along now . - You ca n't ! You 'll be shot down . - I must take that risk . - Listen carefully . In case I 'm unlucky , I want you to take back a message to Mr Callender at the Foreign Office . - You are a spy . - That 's such a grim word . - What is the message ? - It 's a tune . - A tune ? - It contains , in code , the vital clause of a secret pact between two countries . I want you to memorise it . The first part goes like this . - # Da-da-da da , da-da de ... # Oh ! Perhaps I 'd better write it down . - got any paper ? It 's OK , I was brought up on music . - Very well . # Da-da-da da , da-da de ... # - The old girl 's off her rocker . - No wonder . Why do n't you face it ? They 'll kill the lot of us . For goodness ' sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . Now we have two chances . You will remember it ? I wo n't stop whistling it . - This is my best way out . - Yes , just about . Even if you do get away , they 'll stop you at the frontier . - We ca n't let her go like this . - It 's a hell of a risk you are taking In this job , one must take risks . I 'm very grateful to you both for all you 've done . I hope pray no harm comes to you and that we shall meet again one day . I hope so , too . Good luck . Good Luck . - Will you help me out ? Now , you take the weight on top . Right you are . Goodbye . - Was she hit ? - I 'm not sure . Well , that 's the end of my 12 . Not much left here either . We 've only got one chance - get this train going . Try and get back to the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do what you tell them . - We 'll bluff them . Who 's coming ? - count on Me . - Me , too . We ca n't all go . You carry on here . If we have any luck , we 'll stop at the points then you can switch them over . You idiots . You 're just inviting death . I 've had enough . Just because I 've the sense to try and avoid being murdered , I 'm accused of being a pacifist . All right . rather be called a rat than die like one . Think for a moment . If we give ourselves up , they 're bound to give us a trial . Stop it . Nobody 's listening to you . Very well , you go your way ... I 'll go mine . - Where are you off to ? - To do the sensible thing . Oh , let the fellow go . I do n't understand ... Oh , please ... Why are n't we going ? They said we were going , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Only one left . I 'll keep that for a sitter . They 're moving away from car and coming towards us . Pity we have n't a few more rounds . It 's funny , I told my husband when I left him that I would n't see him again . Gilbert . Gilbert ! - We 're off ! - Gilbert came through ! Go on , keep going . - Do you know how to control this thing ? - I watched him start it . I know a bit about it . Once drove a miniature engine . Good . I 'll look out for the points . The blighters are chasing us . We ca n't have far to go . Time for my little job - changing the points . That will not be necessary . I am sorry but the points will not be changed over . Will you please be seated ? There they are , just ahead of us . Do you think you can stop it ? Hope so . Keep still until my friends arrive . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing you do n't know .
